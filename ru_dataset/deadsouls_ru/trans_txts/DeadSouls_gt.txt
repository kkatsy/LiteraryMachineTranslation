Chapter first

A fairly beautiful spring small brichka drove into the gates of the Hotel of the provincial city of NN, in which bachelors drive: retired lieutenant colonels, staff captains, landowners who have about a hundred souls of peasants-in a word, all those who call the gentlemen of the middle hand. A lord, not a handsome man, but not a bad appearance, neither too thick, nor too thin sitting; This is not to say that it is old, but not so young. His entrance did not make any noise in the city and was not accompanied by anything special; Only two Russian men, standing at the Kabaki door against the hotel, made some remarks that, however, were more to the crew than to the seated in it. “You see,” one said to the other, “what a wheel!” What do you think, then the wheel will reach, if it happened, to Moscow or will not reach? ” “It will reach,” the other answered. "And in Kazan, I think, will not reach?" “He won’t get to Kazan,” the other answered. This is the end of the conversation. Moreover, when the Brichka drove up to the hotel, a young man met in white caniphaus pantalons, very narrow and short, in a tailcoat with attempts on fashion, from under which a shirt was visible, buttoned with a bronze pistol. The young man turned back, looked at the crew, held the cap of the cartoon, almost flew off the wind, and went his own way.

When the crew drove into the courtyard, the master was met by a tavern servant, or sex, as they are called in Russian taverns, alive and swivel to such an extent that it was even impossible to consider what his face was. He ran out rapidly, with a napkin in his hand, the whole long and in a long demicoton fruit with a back with a back almost on the back of his head, shook his hair and led the gentleman upwardly showing his rest, his peace sent to him by God. The peace was a well -known kind, for the hotel was also a well -known kind, that is, exactly the same as hotels in provincial cities, where, in two rubles per day, passing receive a deceased room with cockroaches, peering out like prunes, from all corners, and the door to the neighboring A room, always made by a chest of drawers, where a neighbor is arranged, a silent and calm person, but extremely curious, interested in knowing all the details of the passing. The outer facade of the hotel answered its insides: it was very long, in two floors; Nizhny was not led out and remained in dark red bricks, even more darkened from dashing weather changes and dirty already on their own; The upper one was painted with eternal yellow paint; Below there were benches with clamps, ropes and trunks. In the coal of these benches, or, better, in the window, a slaughterhouse with a samovar made of red copper and a face was placed as red as a samovar, so you might think that there were two samovars on the window if one samovar had not been with black like a beard.

While the visiting gentleman examined his room, his belongings were introduced: first of all, the white skin is somewhat, somewhat stuck, showing that he was not the first time on the road. The suitcase was introduced by the coachman Selifan, a low man in a sheepskin coat, and a footman of parsley, a small age of thirty, in a spacious used frock frock coat, as can be seen from a leopard shoulder, a little harsh of his eyes, with very large lips and nose. Following the suitcase, a small casket of red tree was introduced with piece -winged birch lining, shoe pads and fried chicken wrapped in blue paper. When all this was introduced, the coachman Selifan went to the stable to mess around the horses, and the footman of Parsley began to arrange in a small front, very dark kennel, where he had already managed to drag his overcoat and at the same time some of his own smell, which was communicated and brought Following that bag with different Lacques toilet. In this kennel, he attached a narrow three -legged bed to the wall, covering it with a small likeness of a mattress, killed and flat, like a pancake, and, perhaps, as oily as a pancake, which he managed to interfere with the owner of the hotel.

While the servants were controlled and fiddled, the master went to the common room. What are these common halls-everyone knows very well: the same walls painted with oil paint, darkened at the top of the tubular smoke and the backs of various passing ones, and even more native merchants, because the merchants on trade days came here by the Samuh and themselves -May to drink your well -known couple of tea; the same smoked ceiling; The same smoked chandelier with many hanging glasses that jumped and rang whenever the sexual man ran along the bended oilcloths, waving a brisk tray on which the same abyss of tea cups was sitting as birds on the seashore; The same paintings in the entire wall, written in oil paints, are in a word, all the same as everywhere; Only the difference is that one picture depicts a nymph with such huge breasts that the reader, rightly, never saw. A similar game of nature, however, happens in different historical paintings, it is not known at what time, where and by whom brought to Russia, sometimes even our nobles, art lovers who bought them in Italy on the advice of the couriers who were driving them. The gentleman threw off the cartuz and unwound the woolen, rainbow flowers of a scarf from his neck, which married spouse prepares with his own hands, supplies with decent instructions, how to hide, but in single - I probably can’t say who does, God knows, I never wore such scarves . Having unraveling the scarf, the gentleman ordered to give himself dinner. For the time being, he was served by various dishes that are different in the taverns, such as: cabbage soup with a puff pie, deliberately saved for passing for a few week, brains with peas, sausages with cabbage, fried fluular, cucumber of salty and eternal layered sweet pie, always ready for services ; While he was given all this both heated and simply cold, he forced the servant, or sex, to tell any nonsense - about who contained a tavern and who now, and whether there was a lot of income, and whether their master was a large scoundrel; To which the sexual, as usual, answered: "Oh, big, sir, fraudster." As in enlightened Europe and in enlightened Russia, there are now a lot of venerable people who can’t eat in the tavern so as not to talk to the servant, and sometimes even funny to joke over him. However, the visiting did not make all empty questions; He asked with extreme accuracy who was the governor in the city, who was the chairman of the chamber, who the prosecutor, in a word, did not miss a single significant official; But even more accuracy, if not even with participation, asked about all significant landowners: how many peasants have, how far he lives from the city, what even character and how often they come to the city; He asked carefully about the state of the region: did there be any diseases in their province-the rampant fever, the murderous of any fever, smallpox and the like, and everything is so thorough and with such accuracy that showed more than one simple curiosity. In his techniques, the master had something solid and squeezed extremely loudly. It is not known how he did it, but only his nose sounded like a pipe. This, apparently, acquired a completely innocent dignity, but he, he was a lot of respect from the side of the innkeeper, so that he whenever he heard this sound, shook his hair, straightened more respectfully and, bending his head from the height, asked: no need to whether what? After lunch, the master bought a cup of coffee and sat on the sofa, putting a pillow behind his back, which in Russian taverns instead of elastic wool they stuff something extremely like brick and cobblestone. Then he began to yawn and ordered himself to take himself to his number, where, lay down, fell asleep for two hours. Having rested, he wrote a piece of paper on a shred, at the request of a tavern servant, a rank, a name and a surname for a message where should be, to the police. On a piece of paper, going down the stairs, I read the following in the warehouses: "College adviser Pavel Ivanovich Chichikov, the landowner, according to his needs." When the sexual was still dismantling the note, Pavel Ivanovich Chichikov himself went to see the city that was, as it seemed, satisfied, for he found that the city was in no way inferior to other provincial cities: the yellow paint of the stone houses was very dark and the gray was modestly darkened On wooden. The houses were one, two and one and a half floors, with an eternal mesonin, very beautiful, according to provincial architects. In places, these houses seemed lost among the wide, as a field, streets and endless wooden fences; In some places they got into a heap, and here it was noticeable more than the movement of the people and liveliness. There were signs almost washed off with rolls and boots, in some places with painted blue trousers and the signature of some Arshavsky tailor; Where is the store with cartules, caps and the inscription: “Foreigner Vasily Fedorov”; Where billiards were drawn with two players in tailcoats, in which guests are dressed in the theaters, which are in the last act on the stage. Players were depicted with aimed kiyas, somewhat torn back with their hands and oblique legs that had just made anthrash in the air. Under all this it was written: "And here is the institution." In some places, there were just on the street there were tables with nuts, soap and gingerbread, similar to soap; Where is the tavern with a fish painted with a thick and stuck in her with a fork. More often than all, it was noticeable of darkened double -headed state eagles, which are now replaced by a laconic inscription: “Petita House”. The pavement was bad everywhere. He also looked into the city garden, which consisted of thin trees, badly accepted, with supports below, in the form of triangles, very beautifully painted with green oil of Kravoy. However, although these trees were no higher than the reed, they were said in the newspapers when describing the illumination that “our city was decorated, thanks to the care of a civilian ruler, a garden consisting of shady, wide -sovereign trees giving coolness on a sultry day,” and that under This "it was very touching to look how the hearts of citizens trembled in an abundance of gratitude and streamed streams of tears as a sign of gratitude to Mr. to the mayor." Having asked the bummer in detail, where you can go closer, if you need, to the cathedral, to the places attended, to the governor, he went to look at the river flowing in the middle of the city, tore off the poster nailed to the pillar, so that, having come home, to read it well, to read it well, to read it. I looked intently at the lady of the notorious appearance passing along the wooden sidewalk, which was followed by a boy in a military livery, with a knot in his hand, and once again casting all his eyes, as if in order to remember the position of the place well, went home directly to his number, Supported slightly on the stairs with a tavern servant. Having chopped down, he sat in front of the table, ordered to give a candle, took out a poster from his pocket, brought it to the candle and began to read, squinted a little right eye. However, there was a little remarkable in the poster: the drama G. Cocebu was given, in which Rolla was played by G. Plevin, the bark - the girl Zyblova, the other faces were even less remarkable; However, he read them all, even reached the price of the stalls and found out that the poster was printed in the printing house of the provincial rule, then turned it on the other side: to find out if there was anything there, but, not finding anything, wiped his eyes, crap a neat tentatively And he put in his casket, where he used to put everything that came across. The day, it seems, was concluded by a portion of cold veal, a bottle of acidic dial and strong sleep in the entire pumping end, as expressed in other places of the extensive Russian state.

The whole next day was dedicated to visits; The visitor went to make visits to all city dignitaries. He was reverending with the governor, who, as it turned out, like Chichikov, was neither thick nor a thin himself, he had Anna on his neck, and even said that he was presented to the star; However, he was a great good -haired man and even he himself sometimes embroidered in Tulia. Then he went to the vice-governor, then he was with the prosecutor, with the Chairman of the Chamber, with the police chief, the farmer, the boss over the state-owned factories ... It is a pity that it is somewhat difficult to mention all the powers of this world; But it’s enough to say that the visitor had an extraordinary activity about visits: he even showed to testify to the inspector of the medical council and the city architect. And then he sat for a long time in a brown, inventing who else to give a visit, and there were no more officials in the city. In conversations with these rulers, he very skillfully knew how to flatter everyone. The governor hinted somehow in passing that you entered his province, like in paradise, the roads are everywhere velvet, and that those governments who appoint wise dignitaries are worthy of great praise. The police officer said something very flattering about urban boiled breeders; And in conversations with the Vice-Governor and Chairman of the Chamber, who were still by state advisers, he even said a mistake twice: “Your Excellency”, which they liked very much. The consequence of this was that the governor made him an invitation to mention the same day at his home party, other officials, too, on his part, some for lunch, some for Bostonchik, some for a cup of tea.

About himself, the visitor, as it seemed, avoided talking a lot; If he said, then in some common places, with noticeable modesty, and his conversation in such cases took several book turnover: that he is not the meaning of this world and is not worthy to care much about him, that he experienced a lot of his century. He suffered in the service for the truth, had many enemies who attempted even to his life, and that now, wanting to calm down, he was looking for to finally choose a place for residence, and that, having arrived in this city, he felt his first dignitaries for an indispensable debt. Here is all that they learned about this new person in the city, which very soon did not fail to show itself at the governor's party. The preparation for this party took two hours of time, and here in the visiting there was such attentiveness to the toilet, which was not even visible everywhere. After a small afternoon sleep, he ordered to serve to wash and extremely long the chill of both cheeks, putting them out of the outside with his tongue; Then, taking a towel from the shoulder of an inn, wiped his full face on all sides, starting from behind the ears and snorting before two times in the very face of a tavern servant. Then he put the shirt in front of the mirror, plucked two hairs out of his nose and directly found himself in a lingonberry bar with a spark. Thus, dressing, he rolled in his own crew along the infinitely wide streets, illuminated by skinny lighting from flickering windows in some places. However, the governor's house was so lit, even for the ball; A stroller with lanterns, in front of the entrance are two gendarmes, fore -ended screams in the distance - in a word, everything is as it should. Having entered the hall, Chichikov had to close his eyes for a minute, because the shine from candles, lamps and ladies' dresses was terrible. Everything was flooded with light. Black tailcoats flashed and rushed in heels and in heaps there and there, as flies are worn on a white shining refinade at the time of the hot July summer, when the old keyboardist chop and divides it into sparkling fragments in front of the open window; The children all look, gathered around, watching the movements of her hard hands, raising the hammer, and the air squadrons of flies raised by light air fly boldly, like the full hosts, and, using the old women and the sun that bothers her eyes, sprinkle tidbits where she sprinkles her eyes where Returning, where in thick heaps. Saturated with rich summer, already at all steps placing tidbits, they flew at all to eat, but only to show themselves, go back and forth along the sugar, rub one about the other back or front legs, or scratch them with them In their wings, or, having stretched out both front paws, rub them over their heads, turn and fly away again, and again fly with new document squadrons. Before Chichikov could look around, as he had already been captured by the arm by the governor, who introduced him immediately to the governor. A visiting guest did not drop himself here: he said some kind of compliment, very decent for a middle-aged person who has a rank not too large and not too small. When the established pairs of dancers squeezed everyone to the wall, he, laying his hands back, looked at them for two minutes very carefully. Many ladies were well dressed in fashion, others dressed in what God sent to the provincial city. Men here, as elsewhere, there were two births: some thin ones, who all appeared near the ladies; Some of them were of such a kind that it was difficult to distinguish them from St. Petersburg, also had very deliberately and tastefully combed bacenbards or simply plausible, very smoothly shaved ovals of faces, also casually drove to the ladies, also said in French And they mixed the ladies in the same way as in St. Petersburg. Another family of men made up thick or the same as Chichikov, that is, not so that too thick, but not thin. These, on the contrary, squinted and backed away from the ladies and looked only on the sides, whether the Governor's servant of the green table for Vista placed where. Their faces were full and round, there were even warts on others, some were also pockmarked, they did not wear their hair on their heads with either chuckles, or in the manner of “Damn me”, as the French say-their hair They were either low -uped, or lubricated, and the facial features are more rounded and strong. These were honorary officials in the city. Alas! Tolstoy can better deprive their affairs in this world than thin ones. Thin ones serve more according to special assignments or are only listed and waging to and there; Their existence is somehow too easy, airy and completely unreliable. Tolstoy never occupies indirect places, and all are straight, and if they sit where they sit, they will sit reliably and tight, so that they will crack and go back under them, and they will not fly away. They do not like external shine; On them, the tailcoat is not as cleverly hidden as that of thin ones, but in the caskets the grace of God. Through the three years in the age of three, not a single soul remained in the pawnshop; Tolstoy was calm, looking-and a house bought in the name of his wife, then in the other end, appeared somewhere at the end of the city, then another house, then near the city of the village, then the village with all the lands. Finally, fat, who served God and the sovereign, having earned universal respect, leaves the service, moves and is made by the landowner, a glorious Russian barin, bakery, and lives and lives well. And after it, again, thin heirs are lowered, according to Russian custom, all the father’s good in the Courier. It is impossible to hide that almost such thoughts occupied Chichikov at the time when he considered society, and the result was that he finally joined Tolstoy, where he met almost all familiar faces: a prosecutor with very black thick eyebrows and a few winking his left eye as if he said: “Let's go, brother, to another room, I will tell you something there,”-a person, however, is serious and silent; postmaster, a low man, but an anger and a philosopher; The Chairman of the Chamber, a very reasonable and courteous person, who greeted him as an old acquaintance, to which Chichikov bowed somewhat to one side, however, not without pleasantness. He immediately met with a very courteous and courteous landowner Manilov and somewhat awkwardly at the eyes of Sobakevich, who stepped on his foot the first time, saying: "I apologize." Immediately he was thrust a card on a whist, which he accepted with the same polite bow. They sat down at the green table and did not get up to dinner. All the conversations completely stopped, as it always happens when they finally indulge in a practical occupation. Although the postmaster was very speech the speech, he, having picked up the cards, expressed his thinking physiognomy on his face, covered the Upper Lower Guboy and maintained this position during the entire time of the game. Leaving the figure, he hit the table tightly with his hand, saying if there was a lady: “I went, old hits!”, But if the king: “Get out, the Tambov man!” And the chairman sentenced: “And I am on the mustache! And I am on the mustache! " Sometimes, when the cards hit the table, expressions broke up: “Ah! It was not, there was nothing to do with the tambourine! ” Or just exclamations: “Worms! worm-hole! Picent! " Or: “Pickendras! Pichurushukh Pichura! " And even simple: "Pichuk!" - The names that they crossed the suit in their society. At the end of the game, they argued, as usual, quite loudly. Our guest also argued, but somehow extremely skillfully, so everyone saw that he argued, but meanwhile pleasantly argued. He never said: “You went,” but: “You deigned to go,” “I had the honor to cover your deuce” and the like. In order to agree even more in something of his opponents, he every time he brought them all his silver tobackers with Finifa, at the bottom of which two violets laid there for the smell. The attention of the visitors was especially occupied by the landowners of Manilov and Sobakevich, which were mentioned above. He immediately inquired about them, recalled immediately several towards the chairman and postmaster. Several questions made by them showed not only curiosity, but also thoroughness in the GOST; For first of all, he asked how many of them the souls of the peasants have and in what position their estates are, and then he was inquired, like a name and patronymic. At a little time, he completely managed to charm them. The landowner Manilov, still not an elderly person who had his eyes sweet like sugar, and squinting them every time he laughed, was from him without memory. He sorry for his hand for a very long time and asked him to convincingly make him his arrival in the village, to which, according to him, there were only fifteen miles from the city outpost. To which Chichikov, with a very polite tilt of his head and a sincere shaking of his hand, replied that he was not only ready to fulfill this with great hunting, but even honor for the most proud duty. Sobakevich also said somewhat laconically: “And I ask to me,” - by a snag, a shoe in a boot of such a gigantic size, which is unlikely to find a leg that answers, especially at the present time, when heroes begin to be withdrawn in Rus'.

The next day, Chichikov went for lunch and evening to the police officer, where from three o’clock after dinner they met Vist and played until two in the morning. There, by the way, he met the landowner Nozdrev, a man of about thirty, defeated small, who, after three or four words, began to say “you”. With the police chief and prosecutor Nosdrev was also on “you” and turned in a friendly manner; But, when they sat down to play a big game, the police officer and the prosecutor were extremely carefully examined by his bribes and followed almost all the cardboard with which he walked. The next day, Chichikov spent the evening at the Chairman of the Chamber, who received his guests in a dressing gown, somewhat oiled, including some two ladies. Then he was at the evening at the vice-governor, at a large dinner at the farm, at a small dinner by the prosecutor, who, however, was worth a big; On a snack after a lunch with a given city head, which was also worth dinner. In a word, not a single hour he had to stay at home, and he came to the hotel only to fall asleep. The newcomer in everything somehow knew how to find himself and showed an experienced secular man. Whatever the conversation, he always knew how to support him: whether he was talking about a horse factory, he spoke of a horse factory; whether they talked about good dogs, and here he reported very sensible remarks; whether they interpreted regarding the investigation produced by a state tent - he showed that he was not known to the judicial tricks; Whether there was a reasoning about the billiard game - and in the billiard game he did not give a miss; whether they talked about virtues, and he reasoned about virtue very well, even with tears in his eyes; about the dressing of hot wine, and in hot wine he knew the crook; He judged by customs examiners and officials, and he judged them as if he were both an official and overseer. But it is remarkable that he knew how to put on all this with some kind of degree, he knew how to keep himself well. He spoke neither loudly nor quietly, but completely as it should. In a word, wherever you turn, there was a very decent person. All officials were satisfied with the arrival of a new face. The governor said about him that he was a well -intentioned person; The prosecutor is that he is a good man; The gendarme colonel said that he is a scientist; Chairman of the Chamber - that he is a knowledgeable and venerable person; The police officer is that he is a venerable and amiable person; The wife of the police chief is that he is a gracious and courteous person. Even Sobakevich himself, who rarely spoke about someone from the good side, having arrived quite late from the city and already completely undressed and laid on the bed near the thin wife of his own, told her: “I, Darling, was at the governor at the evening, and with the police officer I had lunch, and met with my college adviser Pavel Ivanovich Chichikov: a preferential man! ” To which the wife replied: "Um!" - And pushed him with a foot.

Such an opinion, very flattering for the guest, was about him in the city, and it was held until one strange property of the guest and the enterprise, or, as they say in the provinces, the passage, which the reader soon learns, did not bring almost perplexity to the perfect bewilderment The whole city.

Chapter two

For more than a week, a visiting gentleman lived in the city, traveling to parties and dinners and thus spending, as they say, very nice time. Finally, he decided to transfer his visits out of town and visit the landowners Manilov and Sobakevich, whom he gave the floor. Perhaps this was prompted by another, more significant reason, a more serious matter, nearby to heart ... But the reader will learn about all this gradually and in due time, if he has patience to read the proposed story, very long, which has wider after leafing through and It is more spacious as it approaches the end, crowning the case. It was given to Kucher Selifan to be ordered early in the morning to lay horses in a well -known Brichka; Parsley was ordered to stay at home, watching the room and a suitcase. For the reader, it will not be superfluous to get acquainted with these two serfs of our hero. Although, of course, they are not so noticeable, and what they call secondary or even third-stage, although the main moves and springs of the poem are not approved on them and are they relaxing in some places and easily hook them, but the author loves to be extremely thorough in everything in everything And on this side, despite the fact that the Russian man himself wants to be careful, like a German. This will take, however, not a lot of time and place, because it is not much necessary to add to the fact that the reader already knows, that is, that parsley went into a somewhat wide brown frock coat and had, according to the custom of people of his title, a large nose and lips. He was more silent than talkative; He even had a noble motive for enlightenment, that is, reading books, the content of which was not difficult: he did not care whether the advent of a hero in love, just a primer or a prayer book - he read everything with equal attention; If chemistry had been tucked to him, he would not have refused it. He liked not what he read about, but more reading, or, better to say, the process of reading itself, that about the letters always comes out of some word, which the devil knows what and means. This reading was performed more in a lying position in the front, on the bed and on a mattress, which made it from such a circumstance killed and thin as a cake. In addition to passion for reading, he had two more ideas, which made up two other characteristic features: without undressing, as it is, in the same frock coat, and always wear some special air with him, his own smell, responding several residential peace, so it was enough for him only to attach his bed somewhere, even in a uninhabited room, and drag there a greatcoat and belongings, and it already seemed that people lived in this room for ten years. Chichikov, being a very tickling person and even in some cases picky, pulling the air to his fresh nose in the morning, only reconciled and shook his head, saying: “You, brother, know you, sweat, or something. You would go to the bathhouse at least. ” To which Petrushka did not answer anything and tried to immediately do some business; Either he approached with a brush to the hanging bar, or just cleaned up something. What did he think at a time when he was silent, maybe he said to himself: “And you, however, good, are not tired of repeating the same thing forty times,” God knows, it’s hard to know what the yard thinks A serf at a time when the master gives him instruction. So, this is what for the first time you can say about parsley. Kucher Selifan was a completely different person ... But the author will very well consciously occupy readers of low -class people for so long, knowing from experience how reluctantly they get acquainted with low classes. This is already a Russian person: a strong passion to get to the one who, even if one rank was higher, and a hat acquaintance with the count or the prince is better for him of any close friendly relations. The author even fears for his hero, who is only a college adviser. Old advisers, perhaps, will get acquainted with him, but those who have already got to the rank of generals, those, God, may even cast one of those contemptuous views that are proudly thrown by a person at everything that is not repented at his feet , or, even worse, maybe they will pass the murderous for the author inattention. But no matter how regrettable both, but all, however, you need to return to the hero. So, having given the necessary orders from the evening, waking up in the morning very early, washing, wiping away from head to toe with a wet sponge, which was done only on Sundays, and that day happened on Sunday, so that the cheeks became a real atlas in Reasoning smoothness and gloss, putting on a strut -out tailcoat with a spark and then a greatcoat on large bears, he came off the stairs, supported by the arm with one or the other side with a tavern servant, and sat in a Brichka. With a thunder, a Brichka went from under the gate of the hotel into the street. The passing Pop took off his hat, several boys in the glued shirts held out their hands, saying: “Barin, give me an orphan!” Kucher, noticing that one of them was a big hunter to stab on the comma, banged him with a whip, and Brichka went to jump on the stones. Not without joy, a striped barrier was in the distance, which made it possible to know that the bridge, like any other flour, would soon be the end; And several times, hitting the back in the body quite tightly, Chichikov finally rushed along the soft ground. As soon as the city went back, as they had to write, according to our custom, nonsense and game on both sides of the road: bumps, spruce, low liquid bushes of young pines, burning trunks of old, wild heather and such a nonsense. There were a village elongated along the snour, similar to old folded firewood, covered with gray roofs with carved wooden decorations under them in the form of hanging diracles sewn with patterns. Several men, as usual, yawned, sitting on shops in front of the gate in their sheepskin sheepskin coats. Women with thick faces and bandaged breasts looked from the upper windows; The calf looked from the lower ones or protected his pig blindly. In a word, the species are known. Having passed the fifteenth mile away, he remembered that here, according to Manilov, there should be his village, but the sixteenth miles flew by, and the villages were not visible, and if it weren’t for two men who fell out, they would hardly have happened to have a chance in the way. When asked, how far is the village of Zamanilovka, the men took off their hats, and one of them, the former, was smarter and wore a beard with a wedge, answered:

- Manilovka, maybe not lure?

- Well, yes, Manilovka.

- Manilovka! And how you drive another mile away, so here you are, that is, so right to the right.

- To the right? - the coachman answered.

“To the right,” said the man. - It will be dear to you to Manilovka; And there are no lumberries. She is called this, that is, her nickname Manilovka, but there are no lumberries here at all. There, right on the mountain, you will see a house, a stone, in two floors, a master's house, in which, that is, the master himself lives. This is the manlovka for you, but there was absolutely no luminaires here and was not there.

Let's go to find Manilovka. Having drove two versts, they met a turn on the country road, but already two, three, and four miles, it seems, made it, and the stone house was still not visible in two floors. Then Chichikov remembered that if a friend invites to his village for fifteen miles, it means that there are thirty loyal to her. The village of Manilovka could lure the few with its location. The Lord’s house stood a loner on Yura, that is, on a elevation open to all the winds, which he only wanted to blow; The stroke of the mountain on which he stood was dressed with a trimmed turf. In English, two or three flower beds with bush of sirens and yellow acacias were scattered on it; Five or six birches in small bathing in some places have offered their small-leaved liquid peaks. Under two of them, a gazebo with a flat green dome, wooden blue columns and the inscription: “The temple of secluded thoughts” was visible; The lower pond covered with greenery, which, however, is not a curiosity in the Aglitsky gardens of Russian landowners. At the sole of this elevation, and parting on the very slope, the gray log huts were dark along and across and across, which is our hero, for what reasons, at that moment he began to count and counted more than two hundred; Nowhere between them a growing tree or some kind of greenery; Only one log looked everywhere. Two women revived the view, who, having picturesquely picking up the dresses and gnawing on all sides, wandered down in the pond, wandering for two wooden nags torn raging, where two confused cancer were visible and the roach fell; The women seemed to be among themselves in a quarrel and went over for something. At a distance, a pine forest was dark aside as a boring and blue color. Even the weather itself very come in handy: the day was either clear, or gloomy, but some light gray color that happens only in the old uniforms of garrison soldiers, this, however, of a peaceful army, but partly drunk on Sundays. To replenish the picture, there was no shortage in the rooster, the forerunner of the changeable weather, which, despite the fact that the head was shaking to the brain with the noses of other roosters on the well -known affairs of the reduction, throiled very loudly and even patted wings, pulled out like old martials. While approaching the court, Chichikov noticed on the porch of the owner himself, who stood in a green shalon frock coat, putting his hand to his forehead in the form of an umbrella above his eyes in order to consider better an approaching crew. As the Brichka was approaching the porch, his eyes made more fun and the smile spread more and more.

- Pavel Ivanovich! He cried finally when Chichikov crawled out of Brichka. “You still remembered us!”

Both friends kissed very tightly, and Manilov took his guest into the room. Although the time, during which they will pass the canopy, the front and the dining room, is somewhat short, but we will try whether we will have time to use it somehow and say something about the owner of the house. But here the author must admit that such an enterprise is very difficult. It is much easier to depict the characters of a large size: there just throw the colors from the whole arm on the canvas, black scorching eyes, hanging eyebrows, a wrinkled forehead, thrown over the shoulder, black or scarlet, like fire, and the portrait is ready; But these are all the gentlemen, who are many in the world, who look very similar to each other, and meanwhile you will see many most elusive features - these gentlemen are terribly difficult for portraits. Here you will have to strain attention, while you make all thin, almost invisible features to speak in front of you, and in general you will have to deepen your eyes sophisticated in science.

God alone could say what the character of Manilov was. There is a kind of people known by the name: people are so -so, neither that nor in the city of Bogdan, nor in the village of Selifan, according to the proverb. Maybe they should also join them Manilov. In the opinion, he was a prominent man; His facial features were not deprived of pleasantness, but it seemed to be transferred to sugar to this pleasantness; In receptions and revolutions, there was something ingratiating location and acquaintance. He smiled tempting, was white -combined, with blue eyes. In the first minute of the conversation with him, you cannot but say: "What a pleasant and kind person!" In the next minute you can’t say anything, and in the third you will say: “The devil knows what it is!” - and go away; If you do not go away, you will feel the boredom deadly. You won’t get any living or even arrogant word from him, which you can hear from almost everyone if you touch the object lifting it. Everyone has his own enthusiasm: one enthusiastically turned to the greyhounds; It seems to the other that he is a strong fan of music and surprisingly feels all the deep places in it; The third master famously lunch; The fourth to play the role of at least one vertex higher than the one that is assigned to him; The fifth, with a more limited desire, sleeps and dreams of how to walk on a walk with the adjutant wing, for showing his friends, familiar and even strangers; The sixth has already been gifted with a hand that feels the desire to break the corner of some kind of hobby, or a deuce, while the seventh hand climbs somewhere order, get closer to the personality of the station caretaker or coachmen-in a word, everyone has their own, everyone has their own, But Manilov had nothing. At home, he spoke very little and thought and thought, but what he was thinking about, it was also known to God. The economy cannot be said that he should be engaged, he never even went to the fields, the economy went somehow by itself. When the clerk said: “It would be good, the master, then to do it,” “Yes, not bad,” he answered usually, smoking a pipe that made a habit when he still served in the army, where he was considered a modest, delicate and educated officer . “Yes, it’s not bad,” he repeated. When a man came to him and, scratching his head with his hand, said: “Barin, let him go to work, to make money,“ go, ”he said, smoking a phone, and it didn’t even occur to him that the man was going to get drunk. Sometimes, looking from the porch to the courtyard and at the pond, he talked about how good it would be, if suddenly, from the house, to hold an underground passage or to build a stone bridge through which would be on both sides of the shop, and so that they sat in them merchants and sold different small goods necessary for the peasants. At the same time, his eyes were made extremely sweet and his face took the most satisfied expression; However, all these spotlights ended only with one words. In his office there was always some kind of book, laid down by a bookmark on the fourteenth page, which he constantly read for two years. Something always lacked something in his house: there was beautiful furniture in the living room, covered with dandy silk matter, which, rightly, was very expensive; But it launched two chairs, and the seats stood covered with just the rogue; However, the owner for several years every time warned his guest with the words: "Do not sit on these seats, they are not yet ready." In another room, there was no furniture at all, although it was said in the first days after marriage: “Darling, you will need to patry tomorrow in order to put furniture in this room for a while”. The inverage was served on the table of a very dandy-bronze of dark bronze with three antique grace, with a mother of mother’s dandy shield, and next to it was some kind of copper disabled person, lame, curled to the side and all in the fat, although neither the owner nor noticed this. The hostess, not a servant. His wife ... However, they were completely satisfied with each other. Despite the fact that for more than eight years their marriage has passed, each of them still brought another one or a piece of apple, or a candy, or a nut and spoke a touching-none voice that expressed perfect love: “Razin, a darling, my mouth, I will put you this one a piece". It itself, of course, that the mouth was revealed in this case very gracefully. There were surprises for the birthday of birthday: some kind of bead cover for a toothpick. And very often, sitting on the couch, suddenly, it is completely unknown from what reasons, one, having left her pipe, and his other work, if only she was holding at that time in her hands, they imprinted each other with such a languid and long kiss that he was continued in continuing You could easily smoke a small straw cigar. In a word, they were, what they say, are happy. Of course, one might notice that there are many other classes in the house, except for long kisses and surprises, and there would be a lot of different requests. Why, for example, is stupid and to no avail in the kitchen? Why is it quite empty in the pantry? Why the thief of the key house? Why are the servants notable and drunkards and drunkards? Why does the whole jacket sleep in a merciless way and stories the rest of the time? But all these are the objects are low, and Manilova is well raised. And good education, as you know, is obtained in boarding houses. And in the boarding houses, as you know, three main objects form the basis of human virtues: French, necessary for the happiness of a family life, piano, to deliver a pleasant moment to the spouse, and, finally, the actual economic part: knitting wallets and other surprises. However, there are different improvements and changes in the meters, especially at the present time; All this is more dependent on the prudence and abilities of the owners of the boarding house themselves. In other boarding houses, it happens in such a way that it was previously piano, then the French language, and there is already an economic part. And sometimes it also happens that before the economic part, that is, knitting surprises, then French, and there is already piano. There are different metes. It still does not interfere with making a remark that Manilova ... But, I admit, I’m very afraid to talk about the ladies, and besides it is time for me to return to our heroes who stood for several minutes in front of the living room, mutually speaking each other to go forward.

“Make mercy, do not worry like that for me, I will go after,” said Chichikov.

“No, Pavel Ivanovich, no, you are a guest,” said Manilov, pointing his hand at the door.

- Do not get used to it, please do not get used to it. Please go through, ”said Chichikov.

- No sorry, I will not allow you to go behind such a pleasant, educated guest.

- Why educated? .. Please go through.

- Well, you please go through.

- Why?

- Well, so! - said with a pleasant smile of Manilov.

Finally, both friends entered the door sideways and slightly squeezed each other.

“Let me introduce you to my wife,” said Manilov. - Darling! Pavel Ivanovich!

Chichikov, for sure, saw a lady that he did not notice at all, bowing in the doorway with Manilov. She was not bad, dressed to her face. A false silk hood of pale color sat well on it; A thin small hand of her hand threw something hastily on the table and squeezed a batisted scarf with embroidered corners. She got up from the sofa on which she sat; Chichikov, not without pleasure, went to her pen. Manilova spoke, somewhat even burping that he very pleased them with his arrival and that her husband did not pass the day, so that he would not remember him.

“Yes,” Manilov said, “she used to ask me everything:“ Why is your friend not going? ” - "Wait, darling, he will come." But you finally honored us with your visit. Such, right, delivered pleasure ... May day ... name of the heart ...

Chichikov, having heard that the case had already reached the name day of the heart, was somewhat embarrassed and answered modestly, that he had neither a loud name, nor even a noticeable rank.

“You have everything,” Manilov interrupted with the same pleasant smile, “you have everything, even more.”

- How did our city seemed to you? - said Manilova. - Was it nice to have time there?

“A very good city, a beautiful city,” answered Chichikov, “and Time was very pleasant: society is the most courteous.”

- And how did you find our governor? - said Manilova.

- Isn't it true that the impocated and adultery? - added Manilov.

“The perfect truth,” said Chichikov, “the premature person.” And how he entered his position, as he understands her! There are more such people.

“How can he, you know, accept everything, survive delicacy in his actions,” Manilov added with a smile and, with pleasure, almost completely closed his eyes, like a cat, who had slightly tickled his ears with his finger.

“A very courteous and pleasant person,” Cichikov continued, “and what a riot!” I could not even assume this in any way. How well he embroiders different home patterns! He showed me his work by a wallet: a rare lady could so skillfully embroider.

-And the vice-governor, isn't it, what a dear person? - said Manilov, again a little squinting his eyes.

“Very, very worthy person,” answered Chichikov.

- Well, let me, but how did the police officer seemed to you? Isn't it true that a very pleasant person?

- Extremely pleasant, and what a smart one, what a well -read person! We lost to him in Vist with the prosecutor and chairman of the chamber to the latest roosters; Very, very worthy person.

“Well, what is the opinion of the police chief’s wife?” - added Manilova. “Isn't it, adultery?”

“Oh, this is one of the most worthy women that I know,” answered Chichikov.

Zasum did not miss the chairman of the chamber, the postmaster and thus crossed almost all the officials of the city, who all turned out to be the most worthy people.

- Do you always spend time in the village? - finally did, in turn, the question of Chichikov.

“More in the village,” answered Manilov. - Sometimes, however, we come to the city in order to see educated people. You are wild, you know, if you live locked up all the time.

“True, true,” said Chichikov.

“Of course,” Manilov continued, “it was another matter if the proximity was good if, for example, such a person with whom in some way could we talk about courtesy, good appeal, to follow some kind of sort of science so that that one The soul stirred, it would give, so to speak, soaring ...-Here he still wanted to express something, but, having noticed that he was somewhat controversial, picked only his hand in the air and continued:-Then, of course, the village and solitude would have a lot to have a lot amenities. But there is absolutely no one ... Only sometimes you read the "son of the Fatherland."

Chichikov agreed with this completely, adding that nothing could be more pleasant, how to live in solitude, enjoy the spectacle of nature and sometimes read some book ...

“But you know,” Manilov added, “all if there is no friend with whom you can share ...

- Oh, this is fair, it is absolutely fair! - interrupted Chichikov. - That all the treasures then in the world! “Do not have money, have good people for circulation,” said one sage.

- And you know, Pavel Ivanovich! - said Manilov, appearing in his face not only sweets, but even a sugary, similar to the Mikstur that the clever doctor sent mercilessly, imagining it to please the patient. -Then you feel some kind of spiritual pleasure ... That's how, for example, now that the case has brought me happiness, you can say exemplary, speak with you and enjoy your pleasant conversation ...

“Have mercy, what a pleasant conversation? .. An insignificant person, and nothing more,” answered Chichikov.

- ABOUT! Pavel Ivanovich, let me be frank: I would be joyful to give half of my whole state to have part of the virtues that you have! ..

- On the contrary, I would feel for my part for the greatest ...

It is not known how the mutual outpouring of the feelings of both friends would have reached if the servant who entered had not reported that the food was ready.

“I'm sorry,” said Manilov. - Excuse me, if we do not have such a dinner as in parquet and in the capitals, we simply, according to Russian custom, cabbage soup, but from a pure heart. I am humblely ask.

Then they argued for a few more time about who to enter the first, and finally Chichikov entered the dining room sideways.

There were already two boys in the dining room, the sons of Manilov, who were in those years when they were already planting children at the table, but even on high chairs. With them stood a teacher who bowed politely and with a smile. The hostess sat down for her soup cup; The guest was planted between the owner and the mistress, the servant tied to the children on the neck of the napkins.

“What cute children,” Chichikov said, looking at them, “and which is a year?”

“The older axil, and the smaller one yesterday only passed,” said Manilova.

- Femistoklus! - said Manilov, turning to the senior who tried to free his chin, tied to a napkin with a footman.

Chichikov raised several an eyebrow, hearing such a partly Greek name, which, unknown why, Manilov gave the end to the “YUS”, but tried the same hour to bring his face to an ordinary position.

- Femistoklus, tell me what is the best city in France?

Here, the teacher paid all attention to Femistoklis and seemed to wanted to jump into his eyes, but finally he completely calmed down and nodded his head when Femistoklis said: “Paris”.

- And what is the best city? - Manilov asked again.

The teacher set up attention again.

“Petersburg,” answered Femistoklis.

- And what else?

“Moscow,” answered Femistoklis.

- Clever, darling! - said Chichikov. “Tell me, however ...” he continued, turning right there with some kind of amazement to Manilov, “in such summer and already such information!” I have to tell you that this child will have great abilities.

“Oh, you still do not know him,” answered Manilov, “he has an extremely many wit.” Here is a smallest, alkid, he is not so fast, and this one now, if something meets, a bug, a goat, so he suddenly has eyes and run away; He will run after her and immediately pay attention. I read him in the diplomatic part. Femistoklus, ”he continued, turning to him again,“ do you want to be a messenger? ”

“I want to,” answered Femistoklis, chewing bread and dangling his head to the right and left.

At this time, the lackey standing behind the messenger wiped his nose, and did very well, otherwise she would have sunk into the soup at a soup at a soup. The conversation began at the table about the pleasure of a calm life, interrupted by the remarks of the hostess about the city theater and about actors. The teacher looked very carefully at the talkful and, as soon as he noticed that they were ready to grin, at that moment he opened his mouth and laughed with zeal. He was probably a grateful person and wanted to pay this owner for a good appeal. Once, however, his face took a harsh look, and he strictly rushed around the table, fixing his eyes at the sitting who were sitting up by his children. It was at the place because the femoistobis was bitten by Alkid's ear, and the alkid, squinting his eyes and opening his mouth, was ready to bury the most miserable way, but, feeling that it was easily possible to lose the dish, brought his mouth to his previous position and began with it. With tears, gnaw on the ram of the bone, from which both his cheeks were glistening with fat. The hostess very often turned to Chichikov with the words: "You do not eat anything, you took very little." To which Chichikov answered every time: "Thank you, I am humble, I am fed, a pleasant conversation is better than any dish."

Already got up from the table. Manilov was extremely pleased and, supporting his guest’s back with his hand, he was preparing to take him into the living room thus, when suddenly the guest announced a very significant look that he intended to talk to him about one very necessary case.

“In that case, let me ask you to my office,” Manilov said and led to a small room, facing the blue window. “Here is my corner,” said Manilov.

“A pleasant room,” Chichikov said, looking at her eyes.

The room was, for sure, not without pleasantness: the walls were painted with some kind of blue paint like a gray, four chairs, one chair, a table on which a book with a laid laying, which we already had the case of mentioning, several scribbled papers, but more There was tobacco in total. He was in different types: in cartoons and in the tobacco, and, finally, it was simply poured on a heap on the table. On both windows, the slides of ash knocked out of the tube were also placed, placed not without effort with very beautiful rows. It was noticeable that this sometimes delivered the owner of the time.

“Let me ask you to sit in these chairs,” said Manilov. “You will be more likely here.”

- Excuse me, I'll sit on a chair.

“Let me not allow you,” said Manilov with a smile. - This chair is already allocated for the guest: for the sake of or not for, but they should sit down.

Chichikov sat down.

“Let me give you a tube.”

“No, I don’t smoke,” Chichikov answered affectionately and, as it were, with a type of regret.

- From what? - said Manilov, too, affectionately and with a type of regret.

- I did not make a habit, I'm afraid; They say the tube is drying.

“Let me notice you that this is a prejudice.” I even believe that smoking a pipe is much healthier than sniffing tobacco. In our regiment there was a lieutenant, the most beautiful and educated person who did not let the tube not only at the table, but even, so to say, in all other places. And now he is now forty years old, but thanks to God, it is still so healthy as possible.

Chichikov noticed that this, for sure, happens and that there are many things in kind, inexplicable even for an extensive mind.

“But let me first one request ...” he said in a voice in which some strange or almost strange expression surrendered, and after which he looked back. Manilov also unknown why he looked back. - How long have you deigned to give a revision fairy tale? [1]

- Yeah for a long time; And better to say, I don’t remember.

- How did you have a lot of peasants from that time?

- I can not know; About this, I believe, you need to ask the clerk. Hey man! Call the clerk, he should be here today.

The clerk appeared. He was a man of about forty years old, shaving a beard who walked in a frock coat and, apparently, spent a very deceased life, because his face looked at a puffy fullness, and the yellowish skin and small eyes showed that he knew too well, What are down jackets and feather beds. One could immediately see that he had done his field, as all the master's clerks committed him: he was previously just a competent boy in the house, then married some Agashka, Barynina Favorus, he became a key holder himself, and there a clerk. And having become a clerk, he acted, of course, like all the clerks: he was found and cummed with those who were rickety in the village, healing [2] worse, waking up at the nine o'clock in the morning, waited for the samovar and drank tea.

- Listen, my dear! How many peasants have died since we were presented with an audit?

- But how much? Many were dying since then, ”said the clerk and at the same time hiccuped, blocking his mouth slightly with his hand, like a shield.

“Yes, I admit, I myself thought so,” Manilov picked up, “namely, very many were dying!” - Then he turned to Chichikov and added again: - Exactly, many.

- And how, for example, a number? - asked Chichikov.

- Yes, how many? - Picked up Manilov.

- But how to say a number? After all, it is not known how much it died, no one counted them.

“Yes, namely,” said Manilov, turning to Chichikov, “I also expected, great mortality;” It is completely unknown how much it died.

“Please you have a list,” said Chichikov, “and make a detailed registry of everyone by name.”

“Yes, everyone is so -name,” said Manilov.

The clerk said: "I am listening!" - and left.

- And for what reason do you need it? - asked the departure of the clerk Manilov.

This question seemed to make up the guest, in his face, there was some kind of intense expression, from which he even blushed-the tension to express something, not quite humble words. And in fact, Manilov finally heard such strange and extraordinary things that human ears had never heard.

- You ask for what reasons? The reasons are what: I would like to buy peasants ... - said Chichikov, hinted and did not finish the speech.

“But let me ask you,” said Manilov, “how do you want to buy peasants: with the earth or just for conclusion, that is, without land?”

“No, I’m not just the peasants,” said Chichikov, “I wish to have the dead ...

-How? Sorry ... I am somewhat tug in my ear, I heard a stopped word ...

“I suppose to get the dead, which, however, would have listed in the audit as living,” Chichikov said.

Manilov immediately dropped a chubuk with a tube to the floor and, as his mouth opened, remained with his mouth open for several minutes. Both friends, who talked about the pleasures of friendly life, remained immovable, ahead of each other's eyes, like those portraits who hung in the old days against the other on both sides of the mirror. Finally, Manilov picked up the tube with a forelock and looked from his bottom in his face, trying to look out if he could see what grin on his lips, whether he was joking; But nothing was visible, on the contrary, the face even seemed more sedate than usual; Then he thought whether the guest was somehow crazy about crazy, and looked at him intently with fear; But the guest’s eyes were completely clear, there was no wild, restless fire in them, which was running in the eyes of a crazy man, everything was decent and in order. No matter how I came up with Manilov, how to be and what to do, but he could not think of anything else, as soon as he released the remaining smoke from a very thin stream from his mouth.

- So, I would like to know if you can be such, not alive to me in reality, but living relatively legal form, to convey, to give in or how do you like better?

But Manilov was so embarrassed and mixed that he only looked at him.

“I think you find it difficult? ..” Chichikov remarked.

“I? .. No, I am not that,” said Manilov, “but I can’t comprehend ... Sorry ... Of course, I could not get such a brilliant education, which, so to speak, can be seen in your movement;” I have no high art to express myself ... Maybe here ... in this, you are now expressed in explaining ... Another thing is hidden ... Maybe you deigned to put it like that for the beauty of the syllable?

“No,” Chichikov picked up, “no, I understand the subject as it is, that is, those souls that, for sure, have already died.”

Manilov was completely confused. He felt that he needed to do something, offer the question, and what question-the devil knew him. He finally finished that he released smoke again, but only not with his mouth, but through the nasal nostrils.

“So, if there are no obstacles, then with God you can begin to commit the merchant fortress,” Chichikov said.

- How, on dead souls is merchant?

- Ah, no! - said Chichikov. - We will write that they are alive, as it costs really in the audit fairy tale. I am used to not getting back from civil laws, although I suffered in the service for this, but excuse me: the obligation for me is a sacred case, the law is Nemea before the law.

Manilov liked the last words, but he still didn’t go to the point of business and instead of an answer began to bury his chubuk so much that he finally began to wheeze like a basket. It seemed as if he wanted to draw an opinion from him regarding such an unheard of circumstance; But the chubuk wheezed, and nothing more.

-Maybe you have any doubts?

- ABOUT! Have mercy, not at all. I'm not talking about that so that I have some, that is, a critical reprehensibility of you. But let me report whether this enterprise will not be, or in order to put it even more, so to speak, Neevity, [3] - so this non -incomprehensible civil decrees and further views of Russia will not be?

Here, Manilov, having made some movement of the head, looked very significantly into Chichikov’s face, showing in all the features of his face and in the compressed lips such a deep expression that, perhaps, was not seen on the human face, unless of some too smart Minister, and even then in the moment of the most puzzling business.

But Chichikov simply said that such an enterprise, or a Needle, would not be inconsistent with civil decrees and further types of Russia, and then added that the treasury would even receive benefits, because he would receive legal duties.

- So do you think? ..

“I believe it will be good.”

“And, if well, this is another matter: I am nothing against this,” said Manilov and completely calmed down.

- Now it remains to agree on the price.

- How in price? - Manilov said again and stopped. “Do you really believe that I will take money for the souls that have ended in some way?” If you have received a sort of fantastic desire, so to speak, then, on my part, I pass them at you are uninterrupted and bale to myself.

A great rebuke would be the historian of the proposed events if he missed to say that the pleasure defeated the guest after such words uttered by Manilov. No matter how it was sedentary and reasonable, but here he almost made a leap on the sample of the goat, which, as you know, is produced only in the most powerful gusts of joy. He turned so strongly in the chairs that the woolen matter faded, tightening the pillow; Manilov himself looked at him in some bewilderment. Encouraged by gratitude, he immediately said so many thanks that he mixed up, blushed, made a negative gesture with his head and finally already expressed himself that this is nothing, that he, for sure, would like to prove to something cordial attraction, the magnesics of the soul, and the dead are dead, and the dead are dead Souls in some way perfect rubbish.

“Very not rubbish,” Chichikov said, shaking his hand. A very deep sigh was emitted here. He seemed to be configured to heartfelt outpourings; Not without feeling and expression, he finally uttered the following words:-If you knew what service this service apparently rendered, rubbish a person without a tribe and family! And indeed, what did I not suffer? Like a barcard among fierce waves ... What persecutions, what persecution did not experience, what grief did not taste, but for what? For observing the truth, that he was clean on his conscience, that he gave his hand to the widow of helpless and the orphan orpan! ..-Here he is even a chopper with a handkerchief of a rolled tear.

Manilov was completely moved. Both friends poured each other's hand for a long time and looked silently for a long time in the other, in which the same tears were visible. Manilov did not want to let out the hands of our hero and continued to reap her so hotly that he no longer knew how to help her out. Finally, pulling her out slowly, he said that it would not be bad to make a merchant as soon as possible and it would be good if he himself had come to the city. Then he took his hat and began to leave.

- How? Do you already want to go? - said Manilov, suddenly waking up and almost scared.

At this time, she entered the office of Manilov.

“Lizanka,” said Manilov with a somewhat compassionate look, “Pavel Ivanovich leaves us!”

“Because we were tired of Pavel Ivanovich,” answered Manilova.

- Madame! Here, ”said Chichikov,“ here, here, ”he put his hand on his heart,“ yes, there will be pleasantness of the time spent with you! ” And believe me, there would be no more bliss for me, how to live with you, if not in the same house, then at least in the very immediate neighborhood.

“And you know, Pavel Ivanovich,” said Manilov, who really liked such a thought, “as it would really be, if you live this way, under the same roof, or under the shadow of some kind of ridge to do something, delve ! ..

- ABOUT! It would be a paradise life! - said Chichikov, sighing. - Farewell, ma'am! He continued, approaching the handle of Manilova. - Farewell, respective friend! Do not forget the requests!

- Oh, be sure! - answered Manilov. - I will part with you no longer for two days.

Everyone went into the dining room.

- Farewell, nice babies! -said Chichikov, seeing Alkid and Femistoklus, who were engaged in some kind of wooden hussar, who no longer had a hand or nose. - Farewell, my crumbs. You will excuse me that I did not bring you a guest, because, I admit, I didn’t even know if you live in the world, but now, as I arrive, I would certainly bring. I will bring you a saber; Do you want a saber?

“I want,” answered Femistoklis.

- And you have a drum; Isn't it a drum? He continued, leaning toward Alkid.

“Parana,” Alkid answered in a whisper and pulling his head.

- Okay, I'll bring you a drum. Such a glorious drum, that way will be: Tourrr ... Ru ... tra-t-ta, t-t-tu ... goodbye, darling! Goodbye! - Then he kissed him in the head and turned to Manilov and his wife with a little laugh, with which they usually turn to his parents, letting them know about the innocence of the desires of their children.

- Right, stay, Pavel Ivanovich! - said Manilov, when everyone had already reached the porch. - Look what clouds.

“These are small clouds,” answered Chichikov.

- Do you know the way to Sobakevich?

- I want to ask you about this.

- Excuse me, I'll tell your coachman now. - Here Manilov with the same kindness told the coachman and told him even once “you”.

Kucher, having heard that you need to skip two turns and turn to the third, said: “Pretfim, your nobleness,” and Chichikov left, accompanied by the hosts of the owners who were in tipped over a long time.

Manilov stood on the porch for a long time, escorting his eyes with his eyes, and when she was already completely not visible, he was still standing, smoking a pipe. Finally, he entered the room, sat in a chair and indulged in thought, sincerely rejoicing that he had delivered a little pleasure to his guest. Then his thoughts were transferred unnoticed by other subjects and finally joined God where. He thought about the well-being of friendly life, about how good it would be to live with a friend on the banks of some river, then a bridge began to be built through this river, then a huge house with such a high underwear, [4] that you can even see from there from there Moscow and drink there in the evening in the open air and talk about some pleasant objects. Then, that they, together with Chichikov, came to some kind of society in good carriages, where they charm everyone with the pleasantness of the appeal, and that the sovereign, who had learned about such a friendship, granted them to the generals, and then, finally, God knows what is, what is it, what is it, what is it, what is it, what is it, what Already he himself could not make out. The strange request of Chichikov suddenly interrupted all his dreams. The thought of her somehow did not particularly boil in his head: no matter how he turned her over, but he could not explain to himself, and he sat all the time and smoked a phone that was drawn to dinner.

Chapter Three

And Chichikov, in a contented mood, was sitting in his Brick, who had been rolling on a pillar road for a long time. From the previous chapter, it is already clear what the main subject of his taste and inclinations consisted, and therefore it is not a marvel that he soon plunged into him with both his body and soul. The assumptions, estimates and considerations that wandered across his face were apparently very pleasant, because they monthly left traces of a contented grin behind. Bushed by them, he paid no attention to how his coachman, pleased with the reception of the courtyard people, Manilov, made very good comments to the Chubaroma, an attached horse drawn on the right side. This struty horse was very crafty and showed only for a look that it was lucky, while a radical bay and an embarrassing Kaura of the suit, called the assessor, because he was acquired from some assessor, worked with all his heart, so even in their eyes there was The pleasure they receive from that is a pleasure. “Cunning, cunning! So I will overdo it! - said Selifan, rising and whipping the whip of the sloth. “You know your job, you are German Pantalic!” The bay is a venerable horse, he fills his duty, I will give him an extra measure with hunting, because he is a respectable horse, and the assessor is the same good horse ... well, well, well! What are you shaking with your ears? You, fool, listen, if they say! I will not teach you, ignoramus. Look where it crawls! " Here he again shook him with a whip, silent: “U, barbarian! Bonaparte you are damned! " Then he shouted at everyone: "Hey, dear!" - And he stuck in all of three no longer in the form of punishment, but to show that he was pleased with them. Having caused such a pleasure, he again addressed the Chubaroma: “You think you will hide your behavior. No, you live in truth when you want you to be honored. Here the landowner, what we had, good people. I will be happy to talk, if a good person; With a good person, we always have our friends, thin friends: whether to drink tea or eat - with hunting, if a good person. A good person will give respect. Here the master respects our everyone, because he, hearing, has completed the state service, he is a clever [5] Advisor ... "

So reasoning, Selifan finally climbed into the most remote abstracts. If Chichikov listened, he would have learned a lot of details that personally treated him; But his thoughts were so busy with their subject that only one strong thunderbone forced him to wake up and look around him; The whole sky was completely covered in clouds, and the dusty mail road sprayed with rain drops. Finally, a thunderous blow was heard another time louder and closer, and the rain poured suddenly from a bucket. At first, having taken the oblique direction, he whipped in one direction of the cube body, then in the other, then, changing the image of the attack and became completely straight, drummed directly to the top of his body; Spray finally began to fly into his face. This forced him to hold over with leather curtains with two round windows, determined for the examination of road views, and order Selifan to go soon. Selifan, interrupted also in the very middle of the speech, realized that, for sure, he did not need to hempat, pulled out some kind of rubbish from the gray cloth from under the goat, put it in his sleeves, grabbed his reins and shouted at his three, which is, which She crossed her legs a little, for she felt a pleasant relaxation from instructive speeches. But Selifan could not remember in any way, he drove two or three turns. Realizing and recalling a few roads, he guessed that there were many turns that he missed everything. Since there is a Russian person in decisive minutes what to do without going into distant reasoning, then, turning the head, on the first cross road, he shouted: “Hey, friends, venerable!” - And he settled down, thinking little about where the taken road would lead.

The rain, however, seemed to charge for a long time. The dust lying on the road quickly kneaded into the mud, and the horses every minute became harder to drag a backbone. Chichikov was already starting to worry very much, not seeing the villages of Sobakevich for so long. By calculating him, it would be time to come for a long time. He looked out around, but the darkness was like that, even though the eye was poured.

- Selifan! He said finally, leaning out of the Brichka.

- What, master? - answered Selifan.

-Look, is it not visible of the village?

- No, master, nowhere is you visible! -After which Selifan, waving a whip, tightened the song not a song, but something is so long, which was not the end. Everything entered there: all encouraging and motivating cries, which treat horses throughout Russia from one end to the other; Adjectives of all clans without further analysis, how the first came into the language. Thus it came to the point that he began to finally call them secretaries.

Meanwhile, Chichikov began to note that the Brichka swayed on all directions and endowed him with fresh tremors; This gave him to feel that they were curtailed from the road and probably dragged on a blank field. Selifan seemed to have realized himself, but did not say a word.

- What, fraudster, what road are you going on? - said Chichikov.

-Well then, the master, do the time; You can’t see a whip, such a Potma! - Having said this, he threw a breeze so much that Chichikov was forced to hold with both hands. Then he only noticed that Selifan was walking.

- Hold on, hold, overturn! He shouted to him.

“No, Barin, how can I overturn,” said Selifan. - This is not good to overturn, I myself know; I don’t overturn. - Then he began to slightly turn the backbone, turned, turned and finally twisted it completely to one side. Chichikov and his arms and legs slapped into the mud. Selifan of horses, however, stopped, however, they would have stopped by themselves, because they were very exhausted. Such an unforeseen incident completely amazed him. Slicks from the goat, he stood in front of the Brichka, leaned on his sides with both hands, while the barin flushed in the mud, trying to get out of there, and said after some thought: “You see!”

- You are drunk like a shoemaker! - said Chichikov.

- No, master, how can I be drunk! I know that this is a bad thing to be drunk. I talked to a friend, because you can talk to a good person, that’s not bad; And they bit together. The appetizer is not offensive; You can eat with a good person.

“What did I tell you the last time you got drunk?” A? forgot? - said Chichikov.

“No, your nobleness, how can I forget it.” I already know my business. I know that it is not good to be drunk. I talked with a good person because ...

- So I will get you like, so you will know how to speak with a good person!

“As your mercy will be in advance,” Selifan answered all the consonant, “if it is carved, then to carve;” I'm not away from that. Why don’t it, if the business is not for the matter, for that. It needs to be sung, because the man dabbled, the order needs to be observed. If the case, then the sides; Why don't you get?

The Barin did not find such a reasoning to answer. But at this time, it seemed as if fate itself decided to take pity on him. A dog bark was heard from afar. The delighted Chichikov gave the order to drive horses. The Russian charioteer has a good flair instead of the eyes; From this it happens that he, with a clamping of his eyes, sometimes shakes his whole spirit and always comes somewhere. Selifan, not seeing ZGI, directed the horses so directly to the village that he stopped only when the Brichka hit the fence and when there was now nowhere to go. Chichikov only noticed something similar to the roof through a dense bedspread. He sent Selifan to look for the gate, which, no doubt, would last long if in Rus' there were no dashing dogs instead of the Switches who reported so loudly that he brought his fingers to his ears. The light flickered in one window and reached the fog to the fence, pointing to our road gate. Selifan began to knock, and soon, opening the gate, some figure covered with an Armenian leaned out, and the master with a servant heard a hoarse woman's voice:

- Who knocks? What diverged?

“Visitors, mother, let go to spend the night,” said Chichikov.

“You see, what a martyr,” said the old woman, “I arrived at what time!” Here you are not an inn: the landowner lives.

- Well, to do, mother: you see, they got down from the road. Do not spend the night at such a time in the steppe.

“Yes, the time is dark, bad time,” Selifan added.

“Be quiet, fool,” said Chichikov.

- Who are you? - said the old woman.

- Nobleman, mother.

The word "nobleman" made the old woman think somewhat.

“Wait, I’ll tell the lady,” she said, and two minutes later she had already returned with a lantern in her hand.

The gates turned away. The light flashed in another window. Brichka, driving into the yard, stopped in front of a small house, which was difficult to consider behind the dark. Only one half of it was illuminated by the light emanating from the windows; The puddle was still visible in front of the house, on which the same light directly hit. The rain knocked sonorously on a wooden roof and gurgling streams flowed into a substituted barrel. Meanwhile, the dogs were filled with all possible voices: one, having thrown his head up, brought out so long and with such diligence, as if God received for this, he knows what kind of salary; the other grabbed his hastily, like a severide; A restless diskant, probably a young puppy, rang between them, like a mailing call, and all this finally turned the bass, maybe an old man endowed with a dozen dog in nature, because he wheezed, as a singing double bass wheezes when a concert in a complete spill: Tenora. They rise to tiptoe from a strong desire to bring out a high note, and everything that is, breaks up, throwing his head, and he alone, putting the unshaven chin into the tie, crouching and dropping almost to the ground, passes his note from there, from which they shake and rattles Glass. Already one dog bark, composed of such musicians, it could be assumed that the village was decent; But our wet and chilled hero did not think about anything, as soon as the bed. Before the Brichka was completely stopped, he had already jumped onto the porch, staggered and almost fell. Some woman, younger than the former, but very similar, came out on the porch. She led him into the room. Chichikov threw two eyes in passing: the room was hung with old striped wallpaper; paintings with some birds; Between the windows, ancient small mirrors with dark frames in the form of rolled leaves; Behind every mirror, either a letter, or an old deck of cards, or a stocking were laid; The wall clock with painted flowers on the dial ... It was not a smittering to notice anything more. He felt that his eyes were sticking, as if someone had been smeared with honey. A minute later the hostess entered, the woman of the elderly, in some sleeping cap, worn hastily, with a flanel on the neck, one of those mothers, small landowners who cry on crop failures, losses and hold their heads a little to the side, and meanwhile they gain a little money. In the variegated bags placed on the drawers of the chests of drawers. All the endings are selected in one bag, in another fifty dollars, in the third quarters, although it seems like there is nothing in the chest of drawers, except under the linen, and night blouses, and threaded fur coats, and a breakdown of the cabin, which then has to turn into a dress if The old one will somehow burn out during the baked festive cakes with all sorts of bucks [6] or will be found by itself. But the dress does not burn and does not isolated by itself; The old woman is careful, and the salop is destined to lie in the form for a long time, and then go according to the spiritual testament of the niece of the grandson sister with all other trash.

Chichikov apologized that he had bought it with an unexpected arrival.

“Nothing, nothing,” said the hostess. - At what time God brought you! The confusion and the blizzard is such ... It should have been eaten from the road, but it's time for night, it is impossible to cook.

The words of the hostess were interrupted by a strange hiss, so that the guest was frightened; The noise looked like the whole room was filled with snakes; But, looking up, he calmed down, for he realized that the wall clock had come to beat. The spike was immediately followed by wheezing, and, finally, having fed with all their might, they pierced for two hours with such a sound, as if someone was pounding with a stick along a broken pot, after which the pendulum went to the right to the right and left.

Chichikov thanked the hostess, saying that he did not need anything so that she would not worry about anything except bed, he did not demand anything, and was only asked to know what places he drove in and whether the way to the landowner Sobakevich, on the landowner, was far from here. That the old woman said that she did not hear such a name and that such a landowner was not at all.

- At least you know Manilov? - said Chichikov.

- And who is Manilov?

- The landowner, mother.

- No, I didn’t hear, there is no such landowner.

- What are there?

- Bobrov, Pig, Kanatiev, Kharpakin, Trepakin, Pleshakov.

- Rich people or not?

- No, father, there are not too rich. Those who have twenty souls, who has thirty, and there are no such people.

Chichikov noticed that he drove into a decent wilderness.

- How far, at least, to the city?

- And there will be sixty miles. What a pity I have nothing to eat! Would you like to drink tea?

- Thank you, mother. Nothing is needed except bed.

- True, from such a road you really need to relax. Here and sit, father, on this couch. Hey, Fetin, bring the feather bed, pillows and sheet. For a while, God sent: such a thunder-I had a candle in front of the image all night. Eh, my father, yes, you have, like Borov, the whole back and side in the mud! Where did he deign to suck so much?

- Glory to God that he was only ragged, you need to thank that he did not break off at all sides.

- Saints, what passions! But is it necessary to rub your back?

- Thank you, thank you. Do not worry, but order only your girl to raise and clean my dress.

- You hear, Fetin! - said the hostess, turning to a woman who went out onto the porch with a candle, who had already managed to drag the feather bed and, whipping her from both sides with her hands, let a whole flood of feathers throughout the room. “You take their caftan along with the same way and previously dried them before the fire, as the dead man was made to the dead man, and after the grinding and groaning well.”

- Listen, ma'am! - Fetin said, befitting a sheet over the feather and laying pillows over the feather beds.

“Well, here's the bed is ready for you,” said the hostess. - Goodbye, father, I wish the late night. But do you need something else? Maybe you're used to, my father, so that someone scratches the heels for the night? My dead man did not fall asleep without this.

But the guest also refused to scratch the heels. The hostess went out, and he hastened to undress for the same hour, giving Fetin to the whole harness removed, both the upper and the lower, and Fetin, also wishing the deceased night, dragged these wet armor. Left alone, he looked not without pleasure at his bed, which was almost to the ceiling. Fetin, apparently, was a craftswoman to beat the feather beds. When, having substituted a chair, he climbed to the bed, she sank under him almost to the floor, and the feathers, pushed out of the limits, scattered into all corners of the room. Having extinguished the candle, he covered himself with a chintz blanket and, curled up under it, fell asleep at the same minute. He woke up the next day, he was already quite late in the morning. The sun through the window shone right into his eyes, and the flies, which yesterday slept calmly on the walls and on the ceiling, everyone turned to him: one sat on his lip, the other in his ear, the third strove to sit down on the very eye, the same one who is the same thing that is the same one who is the same thing that is the same I had the imprudence to get close to the nose nostril, he pulled the very nose in the very nose, which made him sneeze tightly - a circumstance that was the reason for his awakening. Looking at the room, he now noticed that not all of the birds were in the paintings: a portrait of Kutuzov and some old man with red circuits in the uniform were hung between them, as he was thrown under Paul Petrovich. The clock again released hissing and struck ten; A female face looked out at the door and hid at the same moment, for Chichikov, wanting to fall asleep better, threw off completely everything. The peeping face seemed to him as if somewhat familiar. He began to recall for himself: who would be, and finally remembered that it was a mistress. He put on a shirt; The dress, already dried and cleaned, lay near him. Having dressed, he went to the mirror and sneezed again so loudly that the Indian cock came up to the window at that time-the window was very close to the ground-he fell ill with him something suddenly and very soon in his strange language, probably “wish you to like”. To which Chichikov told him a fool. Approaching the window, he began to examine the views in front of him: the window looked almost into the chicken coop; At least, a narrow courtyard in front of him was filled with birds and all kinds of home -made creatures. There were no numbers and chickens; The rooster paced their measures with measuring steps, shaking the crest and turning his head to one side, as if listening to something; The pig with the family found herself right there; Immediately, raking a bunch of Sora, she ate a chicken in passing and, not noticing it, continued to write down watermelon crusts with her order. This small courtyard, or chicken coop, blocked the plank fence, behind which there were lengthy gardens with cabbage, onions, potatoes, beets and other household vegetables. In some places, apple trees and other fruit trees were scattered around the garden, covered with networks to protect from forty and sparrows, of which the latter were transferred from one place to another with whole indirect clouds. For the same reason, several stuffed poles on long poles, with overwhelmed hands, were hoisted; On one of them was the cap of the mistress herself. The gardens were followed by peasant huts, which, although they were built scattering and were not enclosed in the right streets, but, according to the remark made by Chichikov, showed the satisfaction of the inhabitants, because they were supported properly: the extinguished tes on the roofs was everywhere replaced by a new one; The gates did not squint anywhere, and in the peasant covered sheds addressed to him, he noticed where the almost new cart, and where there were two. “Yes, her village is not a little,” he said, and put it immediately to talk and get to know the mistress shorter. He looked into the slot of the door, from which she stuck out her head, and, seeing her, sitting at a tea table, entered her with a cheerful and affectionate look.

- Hello, father. How did you rest? - said the hostess, rising from the place. She was dressed better than yesterday-in a dark dress and no longer in a sleeping cap, but something was still imposed on her neck.

“Good, good,” said Chichikov, sitting in his chair. - How are you, mother?

- Bad, my father.

- How so?

- Insomnia. The whole lower back hurts, and the leg, which is taller than the bones, so so breaks.

- It will pass, pass, mother. There is nothing to look at this.

- God forbid, to have passed. I smeared with pork lard and turbulence I also moistened. And with what will you sip the seagull? In the flask, fruit.

- Not bad, mother, bread and fruit.

The reader, I think, already noticed that Chichikov, despite the affectionate appearance, spoke, however, with more freedom than with Manilov, he did not ceremony at all. It must be said that in Rus', if we have not yet been stolen in something else behind foreigners, then they far overtake them in the ability to handle them. You can not recalculate all shades and subtleties of our appeal. The Frenchman or the German of the age will not smell and will not understand all its features and differences; He will become in almost the same voice and in the same language with a millionaire and a small tobacco trademark, although, of course, in his soul he crashes to the best of the first. We do not have it: we have such sages who, with the landowner who have two hundred souls, will speak completely differently than with the one who has three hundred, but with the one who has three hundred, will not speak again like with Those who have five hundred of them, but with the one who has five hundred, is again not like that with the one who has eight hundred of them - in a word, at least ascend to a million, there are all shades. For example, there is a chancellery, not here, but in a distant state, and in the office, subsequently, there is a ruler of the office. I ask you to look at him when he sits among his subordinates - but you just can’t say a word from fear! Pride and nobility, and why doesn’t he express his face? Just take the brush, and draw: Prometheus, decisive Prometheus! He looks out by an eagle, performs smoothly, measuredly. The same eagle, as soon as he left the room and approaches the office of his boss, is in a hurry with a partridge with papers under his arm that there is no urine. In society and at the party, if everything was a small rank, Prometheus will remain Prometheus, and a little slightly higher, with Prometheus, such a transformation will not invent: Ovid will not invent: a fly, less even a fly, was destroyed in sand! “Yes, this is not Ivan Petrovich,” you say, looking at him. - Ivan Petrovich is taller, and this is both low and thin; He speaks loudly, bans and never laughs, and this devil knows what: Pischs the bird and everything laughs. ” You come closer, you look - exactly Ivan Petrovich! “Eche-he,” you think ... But, however, we turn to the characters. Chichikov, as we already saw, decided not to stand on ceremony at all and therefore, picking up a cup of tea and pouring fruit there, he made such speeches:

- You, mother, have a good village. How many souls are there?

“The shower is in her, my father, nearly eighty,” said the hostess, “but trouble, the times are bad, so last year was such a crop failure that God forbid.”

- However, the peasants look like a chip, the huts are strong. And let me find out your last name. I scattered so ... I arrived at night ...

- Box, college secretary.

- Thank you submissively. And the name and patronymic?

- Nastasya Petrovna.

- Nastasya Petrovna? Good name Nastasya Petrovna. I have a native aunt, my mother’s sister, Nastasya Petrovna.

- And how is your name? - asked the landowner. - After all, you, I am tea, the assessor?

“No, mother,” Chichikov answered, grinning, “tea, not a conesist, but we go to our divisions.”

- Ah, so you are a buyer! What a pity, the right that I sold honey to merchants so cheap, but you would, my father, for me, right, bought it.

- But I wouldn’t buy Medu.

- What else? Is he stump? Yes, it is not enough for me to twist and hemp: half a dam of everything.

- No, mother, another family of the merchant: tell me, did the peasants die?

- Oh, Father, the Osmoen people! - said the old woman, sighing. - And such a glorious people, all workers died. After that, however, it was born, but what is in them: all such a meel; And the assessor drove up - to serve, he says, to pay from the soul. The people are dead, and pay, as for the living. Last week, a blacksmith burned with me, such a skillful blacksmith and locksmith skill knew.

“Did you have a fire, mother?”

- God has saved from such trouble, a fire would be even worse; He burned himself, my father. Inside, he somehow caught fire, drank too much, only a blue light went from him, all decayed, decayed and turned black, like coal, and such was an allevious blacksmith! And now I have nothing to leave: there is no one to poke horses.

- For all the will of God, mother! -said Chichikov, sighing,-nothing can be said against the wisdom of God ... give them to me, Nastasya Petrovna?

- Who, father?

-Yes, these are all who died.

- But how to give in to them?

- Yes, so simple. Or, perhaps, sell. I'll give you money for them.

- But how? I, right, will not take any sense. Do you want to dig out them out of the ground?

Chichikov saw that the old woman had enough and that she needed to explain, what was the matter. In a few words, he explained to her that the translation or purchase would only be listed on paper and the souls would be spelled out as if alive.

- Why are they for you? - said the old woman, bulging her eyes.

- This is my business.

- Why, they are dead.

- But who says they are alive? That's why at a loss to you that the dead: you pay for them, and now I will save you from trouble and payment. Do you understand? Yes, I will not only save, and even more than that I will give you fifteen rubles. Well, is it clear now?

“Right, I don’t know,” the hostess said with a arrangement. - After all, I have never sold the dead.

- Still would! It would rather like a marvel if you sold them to someone. Or do you think that they really have any kind?

-No, I don't think that. Well, in them for a wing, there is no use. It only makes it difficult for me that they are already dead.

"Well, the woman seems to be tight!" - Chichikov thought to himself.

- Listen, mother. Yes, you only judge well: after all, you go bankrupt, pay for it to serve as a living ...

- Oh, my father, and don't talk about it! - the landowner picked up. - Another third week I introduced more than a half -hundred. Yes, the assessor made meant.

- Well, see, mother. Now, accept the only that you no longer need to make the assessor anymore, because now I pay for them; I, not you; I accept all the duties. I will even make a fortress with my money, do you understand this?

The old woman thought. She saw that the matter was, as if profitable, but only too new and unprecedented; And therefore, this buyer did not inflate it strongly, so that this buyer did not inflate it; God arrived knows where, and even at night.

- So, mother, hands, or what? - said Chichikov.

- Right, my father, has never happened to sell my dead. I lost the living, and for the third year the protopope of two girls, according to the steps of rubles each, and thanked it very much, such glorious workers came out: the napkins themselves were trampled.

- Well, but not about the living things; God is with them. I ask the dead.

-Really, I'm afraid at the first pores, so as not to somehow suffer a loss. Maybe you, my father, are deceiving me, and they ... they stand more somehow.

- Listen, mother ... Oh, what you are! What can they cost? Consider: after all, this is ashes. Do you understand? It's just the ashes. You take every worthless, last thing, for example, even a simple rag, and a rag is a price: at least it will be bought to a paper factory, but this is not necessary. Well, tell me, what is it necessary for?

- That's exactly what. No need at all; Why, one stops me that they are already dead.

“Ek Her, what a tunity head! - Chichikov said to himself, already starting to get out of patience. - Go sweet with her! She threw in sweat, damned old woman! ” Then he, taking a handkerchief from his pocket, began to wipe the sweat, which actually appeared on his forehead. However, Chichikov was angry in vain: both venerable and the state even person, but in reality a perfect box comes out. How he cut it to your mind, you can’t overpower it; No matter how much the arguments, clear like a day, bounces everything away from him, as a rubber ball bounces off the wall. Open the sweat, Chichikov decided to try whether it was possible to bring her on the path with what kind of side.

“You, Mother,” he said, “either you don’t want to understand my words, or say so on purpose, just to say something ... I give you money: fifteen rubles in bank notes.” Do you understand? After all, this is money. You do not find them on the street. Well, admit, how much did you sell honey?

- Twelve rubles pood.

- Enough a little sin on the soul, mother. For twelve were not sold.

-By golly, I sold it.

- Well, see it? So it is honey. You collected it, perhaps, about a year, with care, with diligence, troubles; We traveled, frightened the bees, fed them in the cellar for the whole winter; And the dead souls are not from this world. Here you, for your part, did not attach any efforts, there was the will of God for that, so that they left this world, causing damage to your economy. There you received for work, for the efforts of twelve rubles, and here you take for nothing, for nothing, and not twelve, but fifteen, and not silver, but all with blue assistants. - After such strong beliefs, Chichikov almost had no doubt that the old woman would finally give in.

“Right,” the landowner answered, “my business is such an inexperienced widow!” It’s better I am still already time to time, maybe merchants will come, but I will apply to prices.

- Starm, Stram, mother! Just Stram! Well, what are you saying, think for yourself! Who will buy them? Well, what use can he make from them?

“Or maybe in the farm something in a case will be needed ...” the old woman objected, and did not finish the speech, opened her mouth and looked at him almost with fear, wanting to know what he would say for it.

- The dead are on the farm! EC where they had enough! Vorobyov is to scare at night in your garden, or what?

- The Cross with us! What passions you say! - said the old woman, baptized.

- Where else did you want to attach them? Yes, however, after all, bones and graves - everything remains for you, translation only on paper. Well, so what? How? Answer, at least.

The old woman thought again.

- What do you think, Nastasya Petrovna?

- Really, I will not give it all, how can I be; Better I sell you a stump.

- Why hemp? Have mercy, I ask you about something completely different, and you bustle me a stump! Hemp stump, another time I will come, take it and hemp. So how, Nastasya Petrovna?

“By golly, the goods are so strange, completely unprecedented!”

Here Chichikov came out completely from the borders of all patience, grabbed in his hearts with a chair on the floor and promised her a line.

The landowner’s feature was unusually frightened.

- Oh, do not remember him, God with him! She cried out, all turned pale. - Even the third day I dreamed of cursed all night. I decided to make a night on the maps after prayer, yes, apparently, as a punishment, God sent him. Such an ugly dreamed; And the horns are longer than bull.

“I am marveling as you do not dream of dozens.” From one Christian philanthropy I wanted: I see, the poor widow is killed, tolerates the need ... Yes, disappear and steamed with your whole village! ..

- Ah, what kind of take -off you are tagging! - said the old woman, looking at him with fear.

- Yes, you will not find words with you! The right, as if some, not to say a bad word, the mongrel that lies in the hay: he does not eat hay, and does not give others. I wanted to purchase household products from you, because I also lead the state -owned contracts ... - Here he clung, albeit in passing, and without any further thought, but unexpectedly successfully. The official contracts acted strongly on Nastasya Petrovna, at least she had already uttered in an almost askant voice:

- Why are you angry so hotly? I know before that you are so angry, but I would not at all adhere to you.

- There is something to be angry! It’s not worth the case of a vacation egg, but I will get angry because of him!

- Well, yes, please, I am ready to give it for fifteen banknotes! Just look, my father, about the contracts: if it happens to take flour with rye, or buckwheat, or cereals, or cattle with a bat, so, please, do not offend me.

“No, my mother will not offend,” he said, but meanwhile he wiped the sweat with his hand, who rolled into his face in three streams. He asked her if she had in the city of some attorney or acquaintance, who could authorize for the commission of the fortress and everything that should be.

“Well, Protopop, Father Kiril, the son serves in the ward,” said the box.

Chichikov asked her to write a trusted letter to him and, in order to get rid of unnecessary difficulties, he even undertook to compose.

“It would be nice,” the box thought to herself, “if he had taken flour and cattle into my treasury. It is necessary to appease him: there is still a test from yesterday evening, to go to say Fetin, so that the spectla is pancakes; It would also be nice to bend the fresh pie with an egg, they glue it gloriously, and it takes a little time. ” The hostess went out in order to bring the thought about the bent of the pie and, probably, replenish it with other works of a home bakery and shaking; And Chichikov went out into the living room, where he spent the night in order to take the necessary papers from his box. In the living room, everything was already tidied up for a long time, luxurious feather beds were taken out, there was a covered table in front of the sofa. Putting the box on him, he rested a little, for he felt that he was all in sweat, like in the river: everything that was on him, starting from a shirt to stockings, was wet. "Ek was hilarious like a damned old woman!" He said, having a little rest, and unlocked the box. The author is sure that there are readers are so curious who even wish to find out the plan and internal location of the casket. Perhaps why not satisfy! Here it is, the internal location: in the middle of the soap dish, behind the soap of six to seven narrow partitions for razors; Then the square back streets for the sandbox and inkwells with a boat erased between them for feathers, waxy and everything that is more authentic; Then all sorts of partitions with lids and without caps for the fact that it was shorter, filled with tickets, funeral, theatrical and others that were formed as a keepsake. The entire upper box with all the partitions was taken out, and under it there was a space occupied by piles of papers into the sheet, then followed a small hidden box for money, putting forward imperceptibly on the side of the box. He was always so hastily advanced and moved at the same minute as a master that it was probably impossible to say how much money was there. Chichikov immediately took up and, cleansing the pen, began to write. At this time, the hostess entered.

“You have a box, my father,” she said, hooked on him. - Tea, bought it in Moscow?

“In Moscow,” Chichikov answered, continuing to write.

- I already knew this: there is all a good job. The third year, my sister brought warm boots for children from there: such a strong product is still worn. Help, how many stamped paper you have here! She continued, looking at him into the box. And in fact, there was a lot of stamped paper there. - If only I would give me a leaf! And I have such a drawback; The request will happen to the court, and nothing on.

Chichikov explained to her that this paper is not of the same kind that it was assigned to commit fortresses, and not for requests. However, in order to reassure her, he gave her some sheet in a ruble at a price. Writing a letter, he gave her to subscribe and asked a small list of men. It turned out that the landowner did not conduct any notes or lists, but knew almost everyone; He made her immediately dictate them. Some peasants somewhat amazed him with their surnames, and even more nicknames, so every time he, hearing them, first stopped, and then began to write. Some Peter Savelyev disobeyed him especially struck him, so he could not help but say: “Eska is long!” The other had a attached to the name “Korovy Kirpich”, the other turned out to be simply: the wheel Ivan. The ending to write, he pulled a few to his nose air and heard an enticing smell of something hot in oil.

“I ask you to dutifully eat,” said the hostess.

Chichikov looked around and saw that on the table there were already fungi, pies, fleeting, shanies, spinners, pancakes, tortillas with all sorts of priests: with a handle with a ray, a handmade with poppy seeds, a handmade with cottage cheese, a refinery with shootings, and there was no one.

- Fresh pie with an egg! - said the hostess.

Chichikov moved to the fresh pie with an egg and, having eaten immediately with a little half, praised him. And in fact, the pie itself was tasty, and after all the fuss and the drawings with the old woman seemed even tastier.

- And pancakes? - said the hostess.

In response to this, Chichikov turned three pancakes together and, dipping them into melted oil, sent them in his mouth, and wiped his lips and hands with a napkin. After repeating this three times, he asked the hostess to order him to lay his chase. Nastasya Petrovna immediately sent Fetina, ordering at the same time to bring more hot pancakes.

“You, mother, are very tasty pancakes,” Chichikov said, starting to be hot.

“Yes, they bake them well with me,” said the hostess, “but the trouble is: the crop is bad, the flour is so non-abundant ... But what, Father, are you in such a hurry?” - she said, seeing that Chichikov picked up the crankcase, - After all, Brichka has not yet been laid down.

- They will lay, mother, they will laid it. They will be laid soon.

- So, please, do not forget about the contracts.

“I won’t forget, I will not forget,” said Chichikov, going out into the canopy.

- Do you buy pork fat? - said the hostess, following him.

- Why not buy? I buy, only after.

- I will have about Christmas time and pork lard.

- Buy, buy, buy everything, and buy a pork fat.

- Maybe bird feathers will need. I will have bird feathers to Filippov.

“Good, good,” said Chichikov.

“You see, my father, and your Brichka is not ready yet,” said the hostess when they went out onto the porch.

- It will be ready. Just tell me how to get to a big road.

- How to do it? - said the hostess. -Tell me wise, there are many turns; Will I give you a girl to spend. After all, you, tea, have a place on the goats, where to sit on her.

- How not to be.

- Perhaps I will give you a girl; She knows my way, just look! Do not bring her, my merchants already brought it alone.

Chichikov assured her that he would not bring her, and the box, having calmed down, began to consider everything that was in her courtyard; She stood her eyes to the keynet, taking out from the pantry of wooden twin [7] with honey, on a man who appeared at the gate, and little by little all moved to economic life. But why do a box for so long? Lee Box, Manilova, is there a household life or non -economic - past them! It’s not that in the world it is marvelously arranged: a cheerful in an instant will turn into a sad one, if you only stand in front of him for a long time, and then God knows what will be embarrassed in the head. Maybe you will even think: but is it full, is the box worth so low on the endless ladder of human improvement? Is the abyss that separates her from her sister, inaccessfully fenced with walls of the aristocratic house with incense cast-iron stairs, shining with copper, red tree and carpets, yawning behind an witty book in anticipation of a witty-Soviet visit, where she will show her mind to show up and express confidential Thoughts, thoughts that take the city according to the laws of fashion for a whole week, thoughts not about what is being done in her house and in her estates, confused and upset due to the neglusion of economic business, but about what political revolution is prepared in France, which direction has accepted Fashionable Catholicism. But by, by! Why talk about it? But why, among the illuminating, cheerful, careless minutes, a different wonderful stream suddenly burst with himself: still the laughter did not have time to run away from his face, but already became different among the same people, and the face was already illuminated by another light ...

- But Brichka, here is a BRACHIC! Cried Chichikov, finally seeing his Brick approaching. - What are you, a boob, have been digging for so long? It can be seen that yesterday’s hops, you haven’t all filmed it all.

Selifan did not answer this.

- Farewell, mother! But where is your girlfriend?

- Hey Pelageya! - said the landowner standing near the porch of the girl of about eleven, in a dress from homemade krashenina and with bare feet, which could be taken by the boots from a distance, so they were covered with fresh dirt. -Show the barin the road.

Seliphan helped the girl to take off the goat, who, having stood on a lordly step, first stained her with mud, and then climbed onto the top and fit near him. Following her, Chichikov himself put his leg to the step and, having hung up the brown on the right side, because he was heavy, finally fled, saying:

- A! Now good! Farewell, mother!

The horses moved.

Selifan was harshly on the whole road and was very attentive to his business with him, which always happened to him after whether he was guilty of, or was drunk. The horses were amazing how cleaned. The clamp on one of them, worn to the day almost always in a ragged form, so that Pacli peeked out from under the skin, was skillfully sewn up. He was silent all the way all the way, he only crouched with a whip and did not turn any instructive speech to the horses, although the Chubarom Kon, of course, would like to listen to something instructive, because at that time the reins always lazily kept in the hands of a talked charioteer and whip Only for the form was walking over the back. But from the gloomy lips, this time the uniform exclamations were heard this time: “Well, well, a crow! yawn! yawn! " - and nothing more. Even the bay himself and the assessor himself were unhappy, not hearing either “my dear” or “venerable”. Chubariy felt unpleasant blows to his full and wide parts. “You see how it smashed him! - He thought to himself, somewhat supporting his ears. - I suppose I know where to beat! It doesn’t whip right on the back, but chooses the place where it is more lively: it will hook it in your ears or it will fall under the belly. ”

- To the right, or what? -Selifan turned to the girl sitting near him with such a dry question, showing her a whip on the road blackened from the rain between bright green, refreshed fields.

“No, no, I'll show you,” answered the girl.

- Where? - Selifan said when we drove closer.

“Here are Kuda,” the girl answered, pointing with her hand.

- Oh you! - said Selifan. - Yes, this is to the right: he does not know where the right is, where is the left!

Although the day was very good, the earth was so contaminated that the wheels of the Brichka, capturing it, became soon covered with it, like a felt, which was significantly inhabited by the crew; In addition, the soil was clay and the chain is unusual. Both was the reason that they could not get out of the lanes earlier than noon. It would be difficult to do without a girl, because the roads crawled in all directions, like caught crayfish, when they are poured out of the bag, and Selifan would have succeeded through no longer his fault. Soon, the girl showed the hand in the structure in the distance in the distance, saying:

- There is a pillar road!

- And the structure? Selifan asked.

“The tavern,” said the girl.

“Well, now we ourselves will reach,” Selifan said, “go home.”

He stopped and helped her to pass, talking through his teeth: "Oh, you, black -bearing!"

Chichikov gave her a copper penny, and she wandered back, already pleased that she had sitting on the goats.

Chapter Four

Having risen to the tavern, Chichikov ordered to stop for two reasons. On the one hand, in order to give a rest to the horses, and on the other hand, in order to eat and eat somewhat yourself. The author must admit that the appetite and stomach of this kind of people is very jealous. For him, all the gentlemen of the big hand living in St. Petersburg and Moscow, spending time in thinking, are strongly mean to him, so that it would be eaten tomorrow and what dinner to compose for the day after tomorrow, and accepting for this lunch only by sending a pill in their mouth; Swallowing Usters, [8] sea spiders and other miracles, and then going to the Carlsbad or to the Caucasus. No, these gentlemen never excited envy in him. But the gentlemen of the middle hand that the ham at a single station will require, at the other pig, on the third breaking of sturgeon or some baked sausage with onions and then, as if nothing had happened, sit at the table at what time, and sterlet with burbot and nasal It’s hissing and grumbles with their teeth, jammed with a kulebyak with a catfish with a catfish, [9] so that he exchanges appetite - these gentlemen, for sure, use the enviable crushing of the sky! More than one big hand would donate half the souls of the peasants and half of the estates laid down and unnecessary, with all the improvements on the foreign and Russian foot, in order to have such a stomach that a gentleman of the middle hand has; But the trouble that for any money, the lower estates, with improvements and without improvements, cannot be acquired by such a stomach that the master’s middle hand happens.

A wooden, darkened tavern accepted Chichikov under his narrow hospitable canopy on wooden embedded columns, similar to old church candlesticks. The tavern was something like a Russian hut, somewhat larger. Carved patterned cornices from fresh wood around the windows and under the roof sharply and vividly replaced by its dark walls; On the shutters, jugs with flowers were drawn.

Climbing a narrow wooden staircase upstairs, in wide canopy, he met the door opening with a creak and a thick old woman in colorful chintz, who said: “Take a sip here!” The room came across all the old friends who came across in small wooden taverns, which are built on the roads, namely: the frozen samovar, scraped smooth pine walls, a three -year cabinet with kettles and cups in the corner, porcelain gilded testicles before the images hung on the blue and red ribbons, a recent cat, a mirror, showing a mirror, showing instead of two four eyes, and instead of a face some kind of cake; Finally, fragrant herbs and cloves of images, dried up to such an extent that who wanted to smell them only sneezed and nothing more.

- Is there a pig? - Chichikov turned to the standing woman with such a question.

- Eat.

- With horseradish and sour cream?

- With horseradish and sour cream.

- Come on here!

The old woman went to delve and brought a plate, a napkin, stharged to the point that she was breathing like a dried bark, then a knife with a yellowed bone with a column, thin, like a penny, double -toothed fork and a salt shaker that could not be put on the table.

Our hero, as usual, has now entered into a conversation with her and asked if she himself holds the tavern, or is the owner, and how much the tavern gives income, and whether the sons live with them, and that the eldest son of a single or married man, and which one took Wife, with a big dowry or not, and was the father -in -law pleased, and was not angry that he received little gifts at the wedding - in a word, he did not miss anything. It himself, of course, was curious that he was curious to find out what the landowners are in the circle, and found out that all sorts of landowners are: Blokhin, reverence, soapy, colonel Cheprakov, Sobakevich. "A! Do you know Sobakevich? " - he asked and immediately heard that the old woman knew not only Sobakevich, but also Manilov, and that Manilov would be a divorce of Sobakevich: he tells immediately to cook the chicken, he will ask the calf; If there is a lamb, a liver, then he will ask a lamb liver, and just try, and Sobakevich will ask something with one, but he will eat everything, even the ink will require the same price.

When he talked in this way, eating the piglet, which was already the last piece, was heard the sound of the wheels of the crew of the crew. Looking out the window, he saw a lighthead, drawn in front of the tavern, drawn by the three of the good horses. Two some men crawled out of the Brichka. One blond, tall; The other is a little lower, black. The blonde was in the dark blue Hungarian, black, just in a striped archaluka. From a distance, a stroller was still dragging, an empty, drawn by some long-haired quadruple with torn clamps and rope harness. Blonde immediately went upstairs upstairs, while the Black Sea still remained and felt something in the Brick, talking right there with a servant and waving the stroller that was traveling behind them. His voice seemed to Chichikov as if somewhat acquaintances. While he was considering him, the blonde managed to find the door and open it. He was a tall man, thin face, or what is called minted, with red tendrils. He could conclude that he could conclude that he knew, what smoke was, if not powder, then at least tobacco. He politely bowed to Chichikov, to which the latter answered the same. In continuation of a few minutes, they would probably talk and met well among themselves, because the beginning was already done, and both almost at the same time expressed pleasure that the dust on the road was completely nailed yesterday's rain and now go both cool and pleasantly, As his browning comrade entered, throwing his casing from his head on the table, youngly ruffling his black thick hair with his hand. It was a medium height, a very well -folded well done with full ruddy cheeks, with white teeth and black, like stain, with bacenbards. He was fresh like blood with milk; Health seemed to be pissing from his face.

- Ba, ba, ba! He cried out suddenly, placing both hands at the sight of Chichikov. - What fate?

Chichikov recognized Nozdrev, the very one with whom he had lunch at the prosecutor and who, with him in a few minutes, fell on such a short leg that he began to say “you”, although, however, for his part he did not give up any reason.

- Where did you go? - said Nozdrev and, without waiting for an answer, continued: - And I, brother, from the fair. Congratulations: blown up at the fluff! Do you believe that never in life has been so blown up. After all, I came to the philistine! Look on the window on purpose! - Here he bent Chichikov’s head, so he almost hit her on the frame. - See what a rubbish! The violent was dragged, damned, I have already climbed into his Brichka. - Saying this, Nozdrev pointed a finger at his comrade. - Are you not familiar yet? My son -in -law Mizhuyev! We talked about you all morning. "Well, look, I say if we do not meet Chichikov." Well, brother, if you knew how I was blown up! Whether you believe that not only smelled of four trotches - he lowered everything. After all, there is no chain or watch on me ... - Chichikov looked and saw exactly that there was no chain or watch on him. It even seemed to him that he had less and not as Gust as another as another. “But there were only twenty rubles in my pocket,” Knozdrev continued.

“You, however, said so then,” answered Blonde, “and when I gave you fifty rubles, I immediately packed them.”

- And I would not have sought it! By golly, I would not have seated! I do not make stupidity myself, right, I would not have drifted. I don’t rot after a password on the damned seven duck, [10] I could break the whole bank.

“However, he didn’t disrupt,” said Blonde.

- He did not disrupt because he was bent at the duck at the wrong time. Do you think your major plays well?

“Good or not good, but he beat you.”

- Eka importance! - said Nozdrev, - that one and I will beat him. No, so try to play with an arc, [11] So then I will see, I will see then what a player he is! But, Brother Chichikov, as we paid in the early days! True, the fair was the most excellent. The merchants themselves say that there has never been such a congress. I have everything that I was brought from the village was sold at the most favorable price. Eh, brother, how they paid! Now even as you remember ... Damn it! That is, what a pity that you were not. Imagine that three miles from the city stood a dragon regiment. Do you believe that the officers, how many of them were, forty people alone were in the city; As we started, brother, drink ... Headquarters of kisses ... so glorious! mustache, brother, such! Bordeaux just calls a burdashk. "Bring, brother, he says, burdashki!" Lieutenant Kuvshinnikov ... Ah, brother, what a bonus! Well, we can say, in all its shape, I had a lot of shape. We were all with him. What wine Ponomarev let us go! You need to know that he is a fraudster and nothing can be taken in his shop: all sorts of rubbish interfere with the wine: sandalwood, burned cork and even an elderberry, scoundrel, grinds; But then if he pulls out of the distant room, which is called special, some bottle-well, just, brother, you are in the empires. We had this champagne - what was the governor before it? Just kvass. Imagine, not Kliko, but some kind of cloud-mattur, which means a double clique. And he also took out one bottle of French under the name Bonbon. Smell? - The socket and everything you want. Well, they paid like that! .. After us, some prince arrived, sent to the shop for champagne, there is not a single bottle in the whole city, all the officers drank. Do you believe that I alone drunk the seventeen bottles of champagne in continuation of dinner.

“Well, you won’t drink seventeen bottles,” the blonde remarked.

“As an honest person, I say that I drank,” answered Nozdrev.

“You can tell yourself what you want, but I tell you that you won’t drink ten.”

- Well, you want about the laying that I will drink!

- What about the lay?

- Well, put your gun that you bought in the city.

- Don't want.

- Well, put it, try it!

- And I don't want to try.

- Yes, you would be without a gun, like without a hat. Eh, Brother Chichikov, that is, how I regretted that you were not. I know that you would not part with the lieutenant Kuvshinnikov. How much you would have agreed with him! This is not like the prosecutor and all the provincial guns in our city, which are shaking for every penny. This, a brother, and in Galbik, [12] both in a banch and in everything you want. Eh, Chichikov, what would you have to come? Really, the lead for this, the cattle breeder is like! Kiss me, soul, death love you! Mizhuyev, look, now fate has brought it: well, what is he to me or me? He arrived God knows where, I also live here ... And how much was, brother, carriage, and all this is en Gros. [13] In Fortunka [14] he twisted: won two lipstick cans, a porcelain cup and a guitar; Then he put it again once and scrolled, the clunism, more than six targets. And what, if you knew, the red tape of the jugs! We were at all almost balls. One was so ragged, ruffles on her, and tricks, and the devil knows what was not ... I think only: “Damn it!” And the jugs, that is, it is such a beast, sat down to her and in French let her in such compliments ... Do you believe it, did not miss simple women. He calls this: to use a strawberry. Pisces and Balykov brought the wonderful. I brought one with me; It’s good that I guessed to buy when there was still money. Where are you going now?

“And I'm to the man to one,” said Chichikov.

- Well, what a little man, throw him! Let's go to me!

- No, you can’t do it.

- Well, that's the point! Well invented! Oh you, Opoddodok Ivanovich!

- Right, business, and even necessary.

- I hold Paris, you're lying! Well, tell me who are you going to?

- Well, to Sobakevich.

Here Nozdrev laughed with the sonorous laugh that only a fresh, healthy person is poured, whose whites, teeth, teeth, tremble and jump, and a neighbor behind two doors, in the third room, are thrown out of sleep, pulling out the eyes and jumping out and jumping out to the last. Saying: "Ec dismantled it!"

- What is funny? - said Chichikov, partly dissatisfied with such a laugh.

But Nozdrev continued to laugh at the whole throat, saying:

- Oh, mercy, right, I will crack with laughter!

“There is nothing funny: I gave him a word,” said Chichikov.

“Why, you will not be glad of life when you come to him, it's just an older!” After all, I know your character, you are brutally taken aback if you think to find a banch and a good bottle of some bonbon there. Listen, brother: Well, to hell with Sobakevich, let's go to me! What a ball I will finish! Ponomarev, beast, so bowed, said: “For you, only the whole fair, says, searrate, will not find this.” The rogue, however, is terrible. I said to him in the eye: "You, I say, with our farmer, the first scammers!" Laughs, beast, stroking the beard. Kuvshinnikov and I had breakfast every day in his shop. Ah, brother, I forgot to tell you: I know that you will not be lag behind now, but I won’t give it out for ten thousand, I say in advance. Hey Porfiry! -he cried, approaching the window, his man who held a knife in one hand, and in the other crust of bread with a piece of a ball, which was lucky to cut off, taking out something from the Brichka. “Hey, Porfiry,” Nozdrev shouted, “bring the puppy!” What a puppy! He continued, turning to Chichikov. - The stolen, the owner did not give himself for himself. I promised him a kauya mare, which, remember, I exchanged at Khvostyrev ... - Chichikov, however, did not see the blessing either with a kaurus of a mare or Khvostyrev.

- Barin! Do you want to eat anything? - said at that time, approaching him, the old woman.

- Nothing. Eh, brother, how they paid! However, give a glass of vodka; What do you have?

“Anise,” answered the old woman.

“Well, come on Anisova,” said Nozdrev.

- Come on me a glass! - said Blonde.

- In the theater, one actress so, a Canal, sang like a canary! Kuvshinnikov, who was sitting near me, “here, he says, brother, would use to use a strawberry!” I think there were fifty booths alone. Fenardi [15] turned around for four hours with a mill. - Here he took a glass from the hands of an old woman, who bowed low to him. - Ah, come here! He shouted, seeing Porfiry, who entered with a puppy. Porfiry was dressed, as well as the master, in some archaluka, quilted on Vata, but somewhat more humble.

- Come on him, put here on the floor!

Porfiry laid the puppy on the floor, which, stretched out on all four paws, sniffed the ground.

- Here is a puppy! - said Nozdrev, taking his back and raising his hand. The puppy let out a rather plaintive howl.

“You, however, did not do what I told you,” said Nozdrev, turning to Porfiry and looking carefully at the puppy’s belly, “and did not think to comb it out?”

- No, I combed it.

- Why fleas?

- I can not know. It may become, somehow from the Brichka, they climbed.

- You're lying, you're lying, and did not imagine it; I think, a fool, I still let his own. Look, Chichikov, look what ears, feel like a hand.

- Why, I already see: good breed! - answered Chichikov.

-No, take it on purpose, feel your ears!

Chichikov, as well, felt his ears, silent:

- Yes, the dog will be good.

- And your nose, you feel how cold? Take your hand.

Not wanting to offend him, Chichikov took it by the nose, saying:

- Good flair.

“Real Mordash, [16]” Knozdrev continued, “I confess, I had a long time to cut my teeth on the face.” On, Porfiry, take it!

Porfiry, taking the puppy under the belly, took him to the Brick.

- Listen, Chichikov, you must certainly go to me now, five miles of everything, we’re rising in spirit, and there, perhaps, you can go to Sobakevich.

“Well,” Chichikov thought to himself, “I will really go to Nostrev.” What he is worse than others, the same person, and even lost. He’s, apparently, for everything, therefore, he can begged for something for nothing. ”

“We’ll please, we’re going,” he said, “but not to delay, I am expensive for me.”

- Well, soul, this is so! This is good, wait, I will kiss you for that. - Here Nozdrev and Chichikov kissed. - And glorious: the three of us and roll it!

“No, please let me go,” said Blonde, “I need to go home.”

- nothing, trifles, brother, I will not let it go.

- Right, the wife will be angry; Now you can transfer here to their Brick.

- Neither, nor! And don't think.

The blond was one of those people whose character at first glance is some kind of perseverance. You will not have time to open your mouth yet, how they are ready to argue and, it seems, will never agree that they are clearly opposed to their image of thoughts, that they will never call the stupid smart and that they will not be in particular disagreeing on someone else's pipe; And it will always end with the fact that their character will be soft, that they will agree precisely to what they rejected, stupid will be called smart and then go to dance the best under someone else's pipe - in a word, they will begin to smooth out, and finish with a downtime.

- Nonsense! -said Nozdrev in response to some idea of ​​the blonde, put on his head a cartoon, and-the blond went after them.

“For vodka, Barin, they didn’t pay ...” said the old woman.

- Ah, well, good, mother. Listen, son -in -law! Please pay. I have not a penny in my pocket.

- How old are you? - said Zyatk.

“What, father, the double -warrior of everything,” said the old woman.

- You're lying, you're lying. Give her half a tin, [17] Previously from her.

“Little, Barin,” said the old woman, but she took the money with gratitude and still ran in a hurry to open the door for them. She was not at a loss, because she requested four times against the fact that Vodka was worth.

The visitors sat down. Brichka Chichikova was driving next to the Brichka, in which Nosdrev and his son -in -law were sitting, and therefore all three could speak freely between themselves through the road. They followed, constantly lagging behind, a small nostril stroller on skinny inhabitants. Porfiry with a puppy sat in it.

Since the conversation that the travelers waged among themselves was not very interesting for the reader, we will do better if we say something about the nostril itself, which, perhaps, will not play the last role in our poem at all.

Nozdrev's face is true, already familiar to the reader. Everyone had to meet many such people. They are called shattering small ones, they are lying back in childhood and at school for good comrades and, with all that, are very painful. In their faces, something open, straight, remote. They soon meet, and you will not have time to look around, as you already say to you. It seems forever will be involved in friendship: but it always happens almost so that the friends will fit with them the same evening on a friendly feast. They are always talkers, kutiles, dashings, a prominent people. Nozdrev at thirty -five was the same as he was in the sejo and twenty: a hunter to take a walk. The marriage did not change him at all, especially since his wife soon went into the next world, leaving two children, which he strongly did not need. The children, however, looked after a lubricated nanny. At home, he could not sit for more than a day. He heard his sensitive nose in a few dozen miles, where there was a fair with all sorts of congresses and balls; He was already there in an instant of the eye, argued and started a confusion at the green table, for he had, like all of them, a passion for the cards. As we have already seen from the first chapter, he did not play very sinlessly and cleanly, knowing many different overexposures and other subtleties, and therefore the game very often ended with another game: either struck him with boots, or asked the overexposure of his thick and very good Bacenbardam, so he sometimes returned home with only a bacenbard, and then quite liquid. But his healthy and full cheeks were so well created and accepted in themselves so much plant power that the Bacenbards soon grew up again, even better than the previous ones. And what is all strange, what could happen in only one Rus', after a few time he already met again with those friends who were bored, and met as if nothing had happened, and he, as they say, is nothing, and they are nothing.

Nozdrev was in some respects a historical person. Not at any collection where he was, did not do without history. Some story certainly happened: either the gendarmes will lead him to the arms, or they are forced to pour out their own friends. If this does not happen, then nevertheless something will happen that will not happen to another: either it will be sober in the buffet in such a way that it only laughs, or it will be in the most cruel way, so finally it will become conscientiously. And he will do it completely without any need: he suddenly tells that he had a horse of some blue or pink wool, and the like nonsense, so that the listeners finally all leave, say: “Well, brother, you seem to have started to pour bullets to pour the bullets ". There are people who have a passion for the neighbor, sometimes for no reason at all. Other, for example, even a person in ranks, with a noble appearance, with a star on his chest, [18] will reap your hand, talk with you about deep objects, causing thoughts, and then, you look, right away, before your eyes, and Put it to you. And he will encourage like a simple college registrar, and not at all like a person with a star on his chest, talking about objects that cause thought, so you stand only, shrug, and nothing more. Nozdrev had the same strange passion. The closer to him was, he was more likely to succeed with him: he dissolved the fable, whose stupid thing was difficult to invent, upset the wedding, the trade deal did not read himself with your enemy; On the contrary, if the case brought him to meet you again, he did again in a friendly manner and even said: “After all, you are such a scoundrel, you will never come to me.” Nozdrev in many respects was a multilateral person, that is, a person for all hands. At the same moment, he offered you to go anywhere, at least to the ends of the world, to enter whatever the enterprise, to change everything that you want. A gun, a dog, a horse-everything was an object of exchange, but not at all to win: it came from some kind of restless firing and painful character. If he was lucky enough for him to attack a simpleton and beat him, he bought a bunch of everything that had previously caught his eyes in the shops: clamps, smoking candles, shawls for the nanny, stallion, raisins, silver roar, Dutch canvas, grasped flour, tobacco, tobacco, tobacco, tobacco. Pistols, herring, paintings, sharpeners, pots, boots, earthenware dishes - how much money was enough. However, it rarely happened that this was taken home; Almost on the same day, it was all down to another, the happiest player, sometimes even his own tube with a kitty and a mouthpiece was added, and another time the whole quarter with everything: with a stroller and a coachman, so that the owner himself went in a short frock coat or archaluka to look for which -a friend to use his crew. That's what a nostril was! Maybe they will call him the battered character, they will say that now there is no nostril. Alas! The unfair will be those that will say that. Nozdrev will not get out of the world for a long time. He is everywhere between us and, perhaps, only walks in another caftan; But people are frivolously impermerate, and a person in another caftan seems to them a different person.

Meanwhile, three crews rolled up to the porch of the Nozdrev house. There was no preparation for their adoption in the house. In the middle of the dining room were wooden goats, and two men, standing on them, whitened the walls, tightening some endless song; Paul was all sprayed with white. Nozdrev ordered the same hour of men and goats and ran out to another room to give commands. The guests heard him ordered the cook lunch; Realizing this, Chichikov, who began to feel somewhat a little to feel, saw that before five hours they would not sit at the table. Nozdrev, having returned, led the guests to inspect everything in his village, and at two o’clock with a little showed decisively everything, so there was nothing left to show. First of all, they went to look at the stable where they saw two mares, one gray in apples, the other kau, then the bay stallion, in appearance and unpretentious, but for which Nozdrev was afraid that he paid ten thousand.

“You didn’t give ten thousand for him,” said the son -in -law. “He is not worth it alone.”

“By golly, he gave ten thousand,” said Nozdrev.

“You can afraid to yourself as much as you want,” answered the son -in -law.

- Well, if you want, we will beat on the congestion! - said Nozdrev.

I didn't want to fight about the Litimization of the Son -in -law.

Then Nozdrev showed empty stalls, where there were also good horses before. In the same stable, they saw a goat, which, according to the old belief, was revered by the necessary to keep with horses, which, it seemed, was with them in a fret, walked under their belly, like at home. Then Nozdrev led them to look at the wolf wolf, who was on a leash. “Here is a wolf cub! - he said. - I deliberately feed him with raw meat. I want him to be a perfect beast! " We went to watch a pond in which, according to Nozdrev, there was a fish of such a size that two people hardly pulled out a thing, but, however, the relative did not fail to doubt. “I, Chichikov,” said Nozdrev, “I will show the most excellent couple of dogs: the Fortress of Black Meat [19] simply makes amazement, shield [20] - needle!” - And he led them to the very beautifully small house, surrounded by a very beautifully, surrounded by a large courtyard. Having entered the yard, they saw all kinds of dogs there, and dense and pureb, all possible colors and stripes: Murugi, blacks with plowmen, half a bee, Murugo-Tygikh, red-pygihi, black-haired, cereal ... there were all the nicknames, all the imperatives. Enceptions: shoot, collapse, fluke, fire, squeal, Cherkai, [21] bake, bake, north, killer whale, reward, trustee. Nozdrev was among them completely like a father among the family; All of them, immediately putting their tails upward, who were angry with the dogs, flew right to meet the guests and began to greet them. Ten pieces of them laid their paws to the nostrough on the shoulder. The rampant rendered the same friendship to Chichikov and, rising on his hind legs, licked his tongue in the lips, so Chichikov immediately spat out. They examined the dogs that were amazed at the strength of black meat - the dogs were good. Then we went to inspect the Crimean bitch, which was already blind and, according to Nozdrev, was supposed to die soon, but two years ago there was a very good bitch; We examined the bitch - the bitch, for sure, was blind. Then we went to inspect the water mill, where the porks launched, which affirms the upper stone, which quickly rotates on the spindle, “fluttering”, according to the wonderful expression of the Russian man.

- And here will soon be a forge! - said Nozdrev.

After a little, they saw, for sure, for a forge, examined the forge.

“Here on this field,” said Nosdrev, pointing a finger at the field, “Rusakov is so death that the earth is not visible;” I myself caught one in my hind legs with my own hands.

- Well, Rusaka you will not catch with your hand! - noted the son -in -law.

- But he caught, deliberately caught! - answered Nozdrev. “Now I will lead you to see,” he continued, turning to Chichikov, “the border where my land ends.”

Nozdrev led his guests a field, which in many places consisted of bumps. The guests had to make their way between the transfers and the confused Nivas. Chichikov began to feel fatigue. In many places, their legs squeezed out water under them, to such an extent the place was low. At first they were careful and crossed carefully, but then, seeing that it was not serving, they wandered straight, without analyzing where the big and where the smaller mud is. After passing a decent distance, they saw, exactly, a border consisting of a wooden column and a narrow moat.

- Here is the border! - said Nozdrev. - All that you see on this side, all this is mine, and even on the other side, all this forest that turns blue, and everything that is behind the forest is all mine.

- But when did this forest become yours? The son -in -law asked. “Have you recently bought it?” After all, he was not yours.

“Yes, I bought it recently,” answered Nozdrev.

- When did you manage to buy it so soon?

- Well, I bought it on the third day, and it’s expensive, to hell, I gave it.

- Why, you were at that time at the fair.

- Oh you, Sofron! Is it impossible to be at the same time and at the fair and buy land? Well, I was at the fair, and my clerk bought here without me.

- Yes, well, is the clerk! - said the son -in -law, but even here he worsened and shook his head.

The guests returned to the same bastard road to the house. Nozdrev led them to his office, in which, however, there were no traces of what happens in offices, that is, books or paper; Only sabers and two guns hung - one at three hundred, and the other at eight hundred rubles. The son -in -law, examining, shook only his head. Then Turkish daggers were shown, on one of which was mistakenly carved: "Master Savely Sibiryakov." Following that, the guests of the barman appeared. Nozdrev immediately verified something before them. The barbound played not without pleasantness, but in the middle of her, something seemed to happen, for Mazurka ended with the song: “Malbro went on a hike”, and “the Malbroke went on a hike” unexpectedly ended with some long-familiar waltz. Nozdrev has long stopped twirling, but in a barrelmac there was one dudka very lively, who did not want to calm down in any way, and for a long time she whistled alone alone. Then the tubes appeared-wooden, clay, foam, sturred and unwashed, covered in suede and unconscious, chubuk with an amber mouthpiece, recently won, pouch, embroidered with some kind of countesse, somewhere at the post station, falling in love with him over the ears, whose pens were of a handle. , according to him, were the subdindician Seperflu, [22] - a word that probably meant his highest point of perfection. Having bitten the ball, they sat at the table near five hours. Lunch, apparently, did not make up the main thing in Nozdrev in life; The dishes did not play a big role: something was buried, something was not welded at all. It is evident that the cook was guided by some kind of inspiration and put the first thing that came to hand: whether the pepper stood near him-he poured peppers, whether the cabbage was caught-the cabbage, stuffed milk, ham, and in a word, Katai-Valyai, was It would be hot, but some taste, right, will be released. But Nozdrev was lit up for wine: they have not yet served a soup, he had already poured guests with a large glass of port and a state of state, because there are no simple sotern in provincial and county cities. Then Nozdrev ordered to bring a bottle of Mader, better than which Field Marshal himself did not write. Madera, for sure, even burned in her mouth, because the merchants, knowing the taste of the landowners who loved the good Madera, seasoned her mercilessly rum, and sometimes poured royal vodka there, in the hope that everyone would endure the Russian stomachs. Then Nozdrev ordered to bring some special bottle, which, according to him, was both burgonon and champagnon together. He poured very diligently into both glasses, and right and left, and son -in -law and Chichikov; Chichikov noticed, however, somehow in passing that he did not add much to himself. This made him be careful, and as soon as his nostril somehow spoke or poured his son-in-law, he overturned his glass into a plate at the same moment. In a short time, Ryabinovka was brought to the table, which, according to Nozdrev, had a perfect taste of cream, but in which, to amazement, Sivushischi was heard in all its strength. Then they drank some balm that bore such a name that was even difficult to recall, and the owner himself called him a different name for another time. Lunch has long been over, and the wine was tried, but the guests were still sitting at the table. Chichikov did not want to talk to Nosdrev when son -in -law about the main subject. Still, the son-in-law was an outsider, and the subject demanded a secluded and friendly conversation. However, the son -in -law could hardly be a dangerous person, because he seemed to be loaded, plenty and, sitting on a chair, riveted his nose every minute. Noticing himself that he was not in a reliable state, he finally began to ask home, but in such a lazy and sluggish voice, as if, in Russian expression, he dragged his clamps with ticks on a horse.

-And no-no! I will not let it go! - said Nozdrev.

“No, do not offend me, my friend, right, I’ll go,” said my son -in -law, “you will offend me very much.”

- nothing, trifles! We will build this minute a banch.

- No, build, brother, myself, but I can’t, my wife will be in a big claim, right, I have to tell her about the fair. It is necessary, brother, right, you need to give her pleasure. No, do not hold me!

- Well, her wife, to ...! I am important in fact, you’ll start doing the job together!

- No, brother! She is so venerable and true! Services provides such ... believe, I have tears in my eyes. No, do not hold me; As an honest person, I'll go. I assure you in this by true conscience.

- Let him go that he was in him! - said quietly Chichikov Nozdrev.

- And really! - said Nozdrev. - Death I do not like such wanders! [23] - and added aloud: - Well, damn it, go to bite with his wife, Fetyuk! [24]

“No, brother, do not scold me with Fetyuk,” answered my son -in -law, “I owe her life.” Such, right, kind, dear, provides such caresses ... he disassembles tears; He will ask what he saw at the fair, you need to tell everything, such, right, dear.

- Well, go, lie to her nonsense! Here is your cartuz.

- No, brother, you should not speak about her at all; By this, you can say, you offend me yourself, she is so cute.

- Well, so get out to her soon!

- Yes, brother, I’ll go, I'm sorry that I can’t stay. I would be happy with my soul, but I can’t.

The son -in -law repeated his apologies for a long time, not noticing that he had been sitting in a brown for a long time, he had long gone out of the gate and there were only empty fields in front of him for a long time. I must think that my wife has not heard much details about the fair.

- Such rubbish! - said Nozdrev, standing in front of the window and looking at the leaving the crew. - Look how I dragged! The hobby is a harassed ailment, I have long wanted to pick it up. Why, you can’t get away with him. Fetyuk, just Fetyuk!

They went into the room. Porfiry filed candles, and Chichikov noticed in the hands of the owner the stake of cards that came from nowhere.

“And what, brother,” said Nozdrev, pressing his sides with his fingers and slightly bent over her, so that the piece of paper cracked and bounced off. - Well, for the transfer of time, I keep three hundred rubles to the bank!

But Chichikov pretended, as if he had not heard what it was about, and said, as if suddenly recalling:

- A! So as not to forget: I have a request for you.

- Which?

- Give me a word before that you will fulfill.

- What a request?

- Well, yes, give a word!

- Please.

- Honestly?

- Honestly.

- Here's the request: you have, tea, many dead peasants who have not yet been crossed out of the audit?

- Well, is it?

- Take them to me, in my name.

- And what do you need?

- Well, I need it.

- What?

- Well, you need it ... This is my business, - in a word, you need.

-Well, right, I started something. Admit what?

- Why did you start? From a sort of trifle and nothing can be started.

“Why are they to you?”

- Oh, what a curious! He would like to feel any rubbish with his hand, and even smell it!

- Why don't you want to say?

- But what do you know for profit? Well, just like that, a fantasy came.

- So: until you say, I won’t do it!

- Well, you see, it’s already dishonest from your side: he gave a word, and for a backward courtyard.

“Well, how do you want, but I won’t do it until you say what.”

"What would he tell him?" -Chichikov thought and after a minute reflection announced that he needed dead souls to acquire weight in society, that he has no large estates, so until that time at least some kinds of souls.

- You're lying, you're lying! - said Nozdrev, not allowing to finish. - You're lying, brother!

Chichikov himself noticed that he did not come up with very deftly and the pretext was quite weak.

“Well, so I’ll tell you better,” he said, recovering, “only, please, do not talk to anyone.” I planned to marry; But you need to know that the father and mother of the bride are preambian people. Such, right, commission: not glad that he contacted, they certainly want, so that the groom has no less than three hundred souls, and since I have almost one and a half peasants ...

- Well, you're lying! You're lying! - Knozdrev shouted again.

“Well, here,” said Chichikov, “I didn’t lie so much,” and showed the smallest part with his thumb on his little finger.

- I put my head that you are lying!

“However, it's a shame!” What am I really! Why do I certainly lie?

“Well, after all, I know you: after all, you are a big fraudster, let me tell you this by friendship!” If I were your boss, I would hang you on the first tree.

Chichikov was offended by such a remark. Already every expression, some kind of rude or insulting decentness, was unpleasant for him. He did not even like to allow the familiar handling in any case, only if the person was too high. And so now he was completely offended.

“By golly, I would hang it,” repeated Nozdrev, “I tell you this frankly, not to offend you, but I just say it in a friendly way.”

“There are boundaries to everything,” Chichikov said with a sense of dignity. “If you want to jam such speeches, so go to the barracks,” and then I added: “You don’t want to give it, so sell it.”

- Sell! Why, I know you, because you are a scoundrel, because you will not give dearly for them?

- Eh, you are good too! Look! What are you diamond, or what?

- Well, it is. I already knew you.

“Have mercy, brother, what about the Jews!” You should just give them to me.

“Well, listen to prove to you that I am not at all some climbing, [25] I will not take anything for them.” Buy me a stallion, I will give you them in addition.

- Have mercy, what is my stallion for me? - said Chichikov, amazed in fact with such a proposal.

- How on what? Why, I paid ten thousand for him, and I give you for four.

- Why do I have a stallion? I do not hold the factory.

- Yes, listen, you don’t understand: after all, I’ll take only three thousand from you now, and you can pay me the rest of a thousand after.

- Yes, I do not need a stallion, God with him!

- Well, buy a kauya mare.

- And mares do not need.

- For the mare and for the gray horse that you saw with me, I will take only two thousand from you.

- Yes, I do not need horses.

“You will sell them, they will give you three times more in the first fair.”

“So it's better for you to sell them yourself when you are sure that you will win three times.”

- I know that I will win, but I want you to benefit.

Chichikov thanked for the location and straightened to both the gray horse and the Kobyla Kaura.

- Well, buy dogs. I will sell you such a pair, just frost on the skin of the skin! Brudasta, [26] with a mustache, wool stands up, like bristles. The barrel of the ribs is incomprehensible to the mind, the whole paw is in a lump, the earth will not be touched.

- Why do I need dogs? I'm not a hunter.

- Yes, I want you to have dogs. Listen, if you don’t want dogs, then buy a barrel organ from me, a wonderful barrel organ; He himself, as an honest person, cost one and a half thousand: I give you for nine hundred rubles.

- Why do I need a barrelman? After all, I am not a German, so that, dragging her on the roads, begging money.

- Why, this is not such a barrel organ as the Germans wear. This is an organ; Look on purpose: all of the red tree. So I will show you her more! - Here Nozdrev, grabbing Chichikov’s hand, began to drag him into the other room, and no matter how he rested his feet on the floor and assured that he already knew what a barrelman, but had to hear again how Malbro went on a campaign. - When you do not want money, so what, listen: I will give you a barrel organ and everything, no matter how much I have, dead souls, and you give me your Brichka and give three hundred rubles to me.

-Well, here's another, but what will I go?

“I'll give you another BRACK.” Let's go to the barn, I'll show you it! You will only replace it, and there will be a miracle of a brown.

"Ek is his restless demon how he had mastered!" - Chichikov thought to himself and decided at all costs to get rid of all sorts of Bricks, charming and all possible dogs, despite the barrel of ribs and the lump of paws incomprehensible to the mind.

- Why, Brick, a barrel organ and dead souls, all together!

“I don't want to,” Chichikov said again.

- Why don't you want?

- Because I just do not want, and fully.

- Eka you, right, is like that! With you, as I see, it is impossible, as is between good friends and comrades, such, right! .. Now it is clear that a two -faced person!

- What am I, a fool, or what? You yourself: why purchase a thing, decisively unnecessary for me?

- Well, please do not say. Now I know you very well. Such, right, Rakalia! Well, listen, do you want a member of a ban? I will put all the dead on the map, a barrel organ too.

“Well, to decide in the bank means to be subjected to unknown,” Chichikov said, and meanwhile glanced at the crew former in his hands. Both waists seemed very similar to artificial ones, and Krap looked very suspicious.

- Why is the unknown? - said Nozdrev. - No unknown! Be only on your side happiness, you can win the damn abyss. She's! Oh, happiness! - he said, starting to throw in exciting enthusiasm. - Oh, happiness! Oh, happiness! There: So it pounds! Here is the damned nine on which I seized everything! He felt that he would sell, and already, closing his eyes, I think for myself: “Damn you, sell, damned!”

When Nozdrev said this, Porfiry brought a bottle. But Chichikov refused decisively both playing and drinking.

- Why don't you want to play? - said Nozdrev.

- Well, because it is not located. Yes, I admit to say, I'm not a hunter at all.

- Why not a hunter?

Chichikov shrugged and added:

- Because not a hunter.

- You are crazy!

- What to do? So God created.

- Fetyuk is simple! I thought before that you were at least a decent person, and you do not understand no appeal. You can’t talk to you as a loved one ... No straightforwardness, no sincerity! Perfect Sobakevich, such a scoundrel!

- Why are you scolding me? Is it my fault that I don't play? Sell ​​my shower alone, if you are such a person that you are trembling because of this nonsense.

- You will get a line of bald! I wanted to, I wanted to give it for nothing, but now you won’t get it! At least three kingdoms come on, I will not give it out. Such an awl, [27] The stove is ugly! Since then, I don’t want to deal with you. Porfiry, go tell the groom so that it does not give oats to the horses, let them eat one hay.

Chichikov did not expect the last conclusion.

- Better, you just didn’t show me in my eyes! - said Nozdrev.

Despite, however, for such a disagreement, the guest and the owner had dinner together, although this time no wines with intricate names stood on the table. Only one bottle with some kind of Cyprus stuck out, which was what Kislyatin is called in all respects. After dinner, Nozdrev told Chichikov, taking him to the side room where the bed was prepared for him:

- Here you have a bed! I don’t want to wish you good night!

Chichikov remained on Nozdrev’s care in the most unpleasant mood. He internally annoyed himself, scolded himself for driving him and lost time for nothing. But he scolded himself even more because he spoke to him about the case, did it inadvertently, like a child, like a fool: for it is not at all the same person to be a nostrough ... nostril man, a man, nostros can lure, give the devil know the devil That, some more gossip will come out-not good, not good. “I am just a fool,” he said to himself. He slept very badly. Some small alpine insects bit him unbearably painful, so that he scrapped with all a handful in a wounded place, saying: “And so that the devil has a damn thing with the nostril!” He woke up in the early morning. First of all, it was, putting on a robe and boots, to go through the courtyard to the stable to order the Selifan to lay the Brichka at the same time. Returning through the courtyard, he met with Nozdrev, who was also in a dressing gown, with a pipe in his teeth.

Nozdrev greeted him in a friendly manner and asked what he was sleeping.

“So -so,” Chichikov answered very dryly.

“And I, brother,” said Nozdrev, “such an abomination climbed all night, which vilely telling, and in the mouth after yesterday the squadron spent the night.” Imagine: I dreamed that I was carved, her! And, imagine, who? You won’t guess for anything: the headquarters of the kisses with Kuvshinnikov.

“Yes,” Chichikov thought to himself, “it would be nice if you were torn in reality.”

-By God! Yes, subject! I woke up: Damn it, in fact, something is scratching-right, bloss witches. Well, you go dress now now, I'll come to you now. It is only necessary to scare the scoundrel of the clerk.

Chichikov went into the room to dress and wash. When after that he went into the dining room, there was already a tea device with a bottle of Roma on the table. There were traces of yesterday's lunch and dinner in the room; It seems that the sex brush did not touch at all. Bread crumbs lay on the floor, and the tobacco ash was even visible on the tablecloth. The owner himself, who did not slow down soon, had nothing under his dressing gown, except for an open chest on which some kind of beard grew. Holding a chubuk in his hand and sipping from a cup, he was very good for a painter, who did not love the fear of gentlemen lifted and curled, like barbering signs, or cut under a comb.

- Well, so what do you think? - said Nozdrev, praying a little. - Do you want to play in your heart?

- I already told you, brother, that I do not play; Buy - please, buy.

-I do not want to sell, it will not be wisely. I will not take off the shit from the devil know what. In the banchik is another matter. We’ll throw at least the waist! [28]

“I already said no.”

- Do you want to change?

- Don't want.

- Well, listen, play checkers, win - yours are all. After all, I have many those that need to be crossed out of the audit. Hey, Porfiry, bring a checker here.

- Labor is in vain, I will not play.

- But this is not in the bank; There can be no happiness or falsehood here: everything is from art; I even precede you that I don’t know how to play at all, unless you give me ahead of me.

“I am, I thought Chichikov to myself,“ I will play the checkers with him! ” I played into the checkers not bad, and it is difficult for him to rise on pieces here. ”

- Please, so be it, I will play checkers.

- Souls go in one hundred rubles!

- Why? Enough if they go fifty.

- No, what kind of kush is fifty? Better, in this amount I will turn on you some kind of middle-term hand or a golden print to the clock.

- Well, please! - said Chichikov.

- How much will you give me ahead? - said Nozdrev.

- What on earth? Of course, nothing.

- At least let my two moves be.

- I do not want, I play badly myself.

“We know you how you play badly!” - said Nozdrev, speaking with a saber.

- For a long time I did not pick up a checker in my hands! - said Chichikov, moving a saber too.

“We know you how you play badly!” - said Nozdrev, speaking with a saber.

- For a long time I did not pick up a checker in my hands! - said Chichikov, moving the saber.

“We know you how you play badly!” - said Nozdrev, moving his saber, and at the same time he pushed his sleeves and another saber with a cuffle.

- For a long time I did not pick up! .. Uh, uh! This, brother, what? Having back her back! - said Chichikov.

- Whom?

“Yes, a saber,” said Chichikov and at the same time saw almost in front of his very nose and another, which seemed to make his way into the ladies; Where did she come from, only God knew. “No,” said Chichikov, standing up from the table, “there is no way to play with you!” This way does not go, three checkers suddenly.

- Why are three? This is by mistake. One moved inadvertently, I will push her away, please.

-And where did the other come from?

- What else?

- But this one that makes his way into the ladies?

- Here you are on, as if you don’t remember!

- No, brother, I counted all the moves and I remember everything; You only now attached her. Her place is where!

- How, where is the place? - said Nozdrev, reddening. - Yes, you, brother, as I see, writer!

- No, brother, this is, it seems, you are an writer, but only unsuccessfully.

- For whom do you read me? - said Nozdrev. - Will I really spit?

“I will not read you for anyone, but I will never play since then.”

“No, you can’t refuse,” said Nozdrev, hot, “the game has begun!”

- I have the right to refuse, because you are not playing as well as a decent honest person.

- No, you're lying, you can't say that!

- No, brother, you yourself are lying!

- I did not spit, but you can’t refuse, you have to finish the party!

“You won’t force me to do this,” Chichikov said calmly and, approaching the board, mixed his checkers.

Nozdrev flared up and went to Chichikov so close that he stepped back two back.

- I'll make you play! This is nothing that you mixed checkers, I remember all the moves. We will put them again as we were.

- No, brother, it's over, I won’t play with you.

- So you don't want to play?

“You yourself see that there is no way to play with you.”

- No, tell me straight, you don't want to play? - said Nozdrev, approaching closer.

- Don't want! - said Chichikov and brought, but, both hands just in case closer to face, because the matter was really hot.

This precaution was very at the place, because Nostrev swung his hand ... And it would very much have happened that one of the pleasant and full cheeks of our hero would be covered with inexistible dishonor; But, happily giving a blow, he grabbed his nostrus by both perky hands and held him tightly.

- Porfiry, Pavlushka! - Shouted Nosdrev in rabies, trying to break out.

Hearing these words, Chichikov, so as not to make courtyard people witnesses to the seductive scene and at the same time feeling that it was useless to hold Nozdrev, released his hands. At this very time, Porfiry and Pavlushka, a dozen guy, with whom it was completely unprofitable entered with him.

- So you don't want to end the parties? - said Nozdrev. - Answer me straight!

“There is no way to end the party,” said Chichikov and looked out the window. He saw his Brichka, who was completely ready, and Selifan seemed, it seemed to be a wave to roll under the porch, but there was no way to get out of the room: two dozen serf fools stood at the door.

- So you don't want to endure the parties? - repeated Nozdrev with a face burned, like in a fire.

- If you played as a decent honest person. But now I can’t.

- A! So you can't, scoundrel! When I saw that not yours, you can’t! Beat it! He shouted frantically, turning to Porphyry and Pavlushka, and he grabbed a cherry chubuk in his hand. Chichikov became pale as a canvas. He wanted to say something, but he felt that his lips moved without sound.

- Beat him! - Shouted Nozdrev, tumbling forward with a cherry chubuk, all in the heat, in sweat, as if approaching an impregnable fortress. - Beat him! He shouted in the same voice as during a great attack he shouts to his platoon: “Guys, go ahead!” -Some desperate lieutenant, whom the eccentric courage has already gained such fame that a folk order is given to hold his hands during hot affairs. But the lieutenant had already felt a marriage enthusiasm, everything went around in his head; Suvorov rushes in front of him, he climbs on a great cause. "Guys, go ahead!" - he screams, not thinking, not thinking that he was already harming the plan of a general attack, that millions of gunpoints were put into the embrasures of impregnable, leaving behind the clouds of fortress walls, which would take off as fluff, his impotent platoon and that the fateful bullet is already whistling, that is already whistling, Preparing to slam his loud throat. But if Nosdrev expressed his approaching, lost, lost lieutenant who came up under the fortress, then the fortress to which he was walking was in no way like the impregnable. On the contrary, the fortress felt such fear that her soul hid in the heels. Already a chair that he decided to defend himself was torn out by serfs from his hands, already closing his eyes, neither alive, he was preparing to taste the Circassian Chubuk of his master, and God knows whatever happened to him; But fate was pleased to save the sides, shoulder and all the well -mannered parts of our hero. In an unexpected way, they suddenly called up, like the clouds of the bells of the bell, the knock of the wheels of the cart flying to the porch was heard, and even in the room heavily snoring and heavy shortness of the heated horses of the stopped three. Everyone involuntarily looked out the window: someone, with a mustache, in a half-naked frock coat, crawled out of the cart. Having inquired in the front, he entered the very moment when Chichikov did not have time to come to his senses from his fear and was in the most miserable position in which the mortal was ever.

- Let me find out who is Mr. Nozdrev here? - said the stranger, who looked in some bewilderment at Nozdrev, who stood with a forelock in his hand, and at Chichikov, who barely began to recover from his unprofitable position.

- Let me know before who I have the honor to say with? - said Nozdrev, approaching him closer.

-Captain-officer.

- And what do you want?

- I came to you to announce the notice reported to me that you are in court before the end of the decision in your case.

- What nonsense, in what business? - said Nozdrev.

- You were involved in history, on the occasion of applying the landowner Maksimov personal resentment with rods in a drunken form.

- You're lying! I did not see the landowner Maksimov!

- Your Majesty! Let me report that I am an officer. You can tell this to your servant, not me.

Here, Chichikov, without waiting for the nostril to answer this, rather, by the hat and the back of the captain-officer, he slipped onto the porch, sat down in the Brichka and ordered the Selifan to drive horses in full.

Chapter Five

Our hero trumpeted, however, in order. Although Brichka rushed to the entire missing and the village of Nozdreva has long passed away, closed with fields, dumps and horseshoes, but he was still looking back with fear, as if expecting a chase that was about to fly. His breath was translated with difficulty, and when he tried to attach his hand to his heart, he felt that it was beating like a quail in a cage. “What a bathhouse set! What are you! " There was a lot of nostril of all kinds of difficult and strong desires; Even bad words came across. What to do? Russian man, and even in hearts. The situation was completely serious. “Whatever you say,” he said to himself, “and not arrived in the captain-officer, I, perhaps, would not have been given more and look at the light of God!” He would have disappeared, like a blister on the water, without any trace, not leaving the descendants, without delivering the future children either a state or an honest name! ” Our hero took care of his descendants very much.

“Esko bad master! Selifan thought to himself. - I have not seen such a master yet. That is, to spit him for this! You better not give a person to eat, and you have to feed the horse, because the horse loves oats. This is his food: that, by example, we are kost, then for him oats, he is his food. ”

The horses, too, seemed to be unprofitable about the nostril: not only the bay and the assessor, but the Chubariy himself was not in the spirit. Although he always got oats worse for him and Selifan was not otherwise poured into his trough, as they said before: “Oh you, scoundrel!” -But, however, it was still oats, and not a simple hay, he chewed him with pleasure and often put his long face in the trough to his comrades to reassure what food they had, especially when Selifan was not in the stable, but Now one hay ... is not good; Everyone was unhappy.

But soon all the dissatisfied were interrupted among the outpourings of their suddenly and completely unexpected way. Everyone, not excluding the coachman himself, came to their senses and woke up only when a stroller with a gier of the horses jumped on them and their heads, a scream of ladies, abuse and threats of someone else's coachman, were heard almost above their heads: “You are a fraudster Edaku; After all, I shouted into your voice: turn off, raven, to the right! Are you drunk, or what? " Selifan felt his oversight, but since the Russian man does not like to confess to the other that he was to blame, he immediately said, recovering: “And what did you get stolen so? Has it laid his eyes in a tavern, or what? " Following Sim, he began to put a backbone back in order to get out in this way out of someone else's harness, but it wasn’t there, everything was confused. Chubariy sniffed his new friends with curiosity, who found themselves on both sides of him. Meanwhile, the ladies sitting in a stroller looked at all this with an expression of fear in their faces. One was an old woman, the other young, sixteen -year -old, with golden hair, very cleverly and sweetly desuited on a small head. Her face of her face circled, like a fresh testicle, and, like him, was white with a transparent whiteness, when fresh, just demolished, it holds against light in the swarthy hands of his witness and passes through itself the rays of the shining sun; Her thin ears also showed out, racing with warm light penetrating them. At the same time, the fright in open, stopped lips, in front of her eyes - all this in her was so cute that our hero looked at her for several minutes, not paying any attention to the Cuteri that had occurred between horses and coaches. "Put, or something, Nizhny Novgorod crow!" - shouted someone else's coachman. Selifan pulled the reins back, the someone else's coachman made the same, the horses backed away a little and then scattered again, crossing the post -tombs. With this circumstance, the Chubarom Kony liked the new acquaintance so much that he did not want to get out of the rut, into which he got unforeseed fate, and, having put his face on the neck of his new friend, it seemed that something was whispering in his ear, probably nonsense The terrible one, because the newcomer was constantly shaking his ears.

They managed to get on such a confusion, however, men from the village, which was, for happiness, nearby. Since such a spectacle for a man is a real grace, the same as for a German newspaper or club, they soon accumulated their abyss near the crew, and only old women and small guys remained in the village. The postmats untied it; Several pumpors for the Chubarom Kon in the face forced him to back up; In a word, they were scattered and divorced. But whether the announcement of the visiting horses felt for separating them from their friends, or just nonsense, only no matter how much their coachman flooded, they did not move and stood as they were dug. The participation of men increased to an incredible degree. Each at the end of the Council went with the advice: “Go, Andryushka, spend the attacked you on the right side, and let Uncle Mityai sit on the root! Sit down, Uncle Mitya! " The lean and long uncle Mitya with a red beard climbed onto the indigenous horse and became similar to the village bell tower, or, better, to the hook that is pulled out in the wells. The coachman hit the horses, but it wasn’t there, Uncle Mityai did not have any advantage of anything. “Wait, stand! - the men shouted. -Sit down, you, Uncle Mityai, are attached, and let Uncle Minyai sit on the indigenous one! ” Uncle Minyai, a broad -shouldered man with black, like coal, a beard and a belly similar to that gigantic samovar in which a knocked down for the whole vegetable market is cooked, hustered on a native, who nearly crumbled under him to the ground. “Now it will go! - the men shouted. - Injection, encourage him! The Prinandor's whip of the one, the solo that he is scorching like a Carmora! ”[29] But, having seen that the matter did not go and did not help, Uncle Mitya and Uncle Minyay sat both on the indigenous, and and on the adaptable put Andryushka. Finally, the coachman, having lost patience, drove off both Uncle Mitya and his uncle, and made it good, because he had such couples from horses, as if they had grabbed the station without translating the spirit of the spirit. He gave them a minute to rest, after which they went by themselves. Chichikov looked at all the continuation of this trick very carefully at a young stranger. He tried to speak with her several times, but somehow he didn’t have to. Meanwhile, the ladies left, a pretty head with thin facial features and a thin village disappeared, like something similar to a vision, and again the road, Brichka, a three of the horses, Selifan, Chichikov, the surface and emptiness of the surrounding fields familiar to the reader. Everywhere, wherever in life, among the callous, rough-packed and untidy-blown-blown low-powered rows of it or among the monotonous-cold and boring-earnest classes of the highest, everywhere there will be a phenomenon that does not look like all that, not similar to all that, What happened to him to see for the same time, which at least once arouses in him a feeling that is not like those that he is destined to feel all his life. Everywhere, no matter what the sorrows, of which our life is weaved, a shining joy rushes cheerfully, like sometimes a brilliant crew with gold harnesses, picturesque horses and a sparkling brilliance of the glasses suddenly swept past some stalled poor village, which did not see anything except the rural The carts, and for a long time, the men stand, yawning, with their mouths open, not putting on hats, although a marvelous crew has long passed away and disappeared from sight. So the blonde also suddenly seemed in a completely unexpected way in our story and also disappeared. Come in at that time instead of Chichikov, some twenty-year-old young man, is he a hussar whether he is a student or just just starting his life in the field, and God! Whatever wake up, does not stir, did not speak in it! He would have stood insensibly in one place for a long time, having put his eyes pointlessly into the distance, having forgotten both the road, and all the reprimands awaiting ahead, and breaking up for the delay, having forgotten himself, and the service, and the world, and everything that is in the world.

But our hero was already middle-aged and examined. He also thought and thought, but more positively, not so unaccounted and even partly thoroughly his thoughts were very founded. “A glorious woman! He said, opening the snuffbox and sniffing tobacco. “But what, most importantly, is good in it?” It is good that she is now only released from some guesthouse or institute, that, as they say, there is still nothing to Babyo, that is, the fact that they have the most unpleasant. She is now like a child, everything is simple in her, she will say that she wants, she will laugh, where she wants to laugh. Everything can be done from it, it can be a miracle, or a rubbish can come out and rubbish! Now, let the mothers and aunts take now for her now. In one year, it will be filled with all kinds of woman so that his own father does not recognize. Where will both inflict and stiffness come from, will turn on the confident instructions, will puzzle and invent who and how, and how to say, how to look at whom, will be afraid of every minute in order not to say more than necessary, finally confused itself And it will end that it will finally lie all his life, and it will just know the devil knows what! ” Here he was silent for some time and then added: “Would it be curious to know whose? What, how is her father? Is the landowner a rich manner or just a well -known person with capital acquired in the service? After all, if, let's say, this girl and give thousands of two hundred of the dowry, a very, very tidbing piece could come out of her. This could be, so to speak, the happiness of a decent person. ” Two hundred thousand people began to be drawn so attractive in his head that he began to annoy himself on himself, why he did not explore from Foretor or coachman, who were passing by the troubles of the troubles. Soon, however, the seeming village of Sobakevich scattered his thoughts and made them turn to their constant object.

The village seemed quite great to him; Two forests, birch and pine, like two wings, one darker, the other brighter, were in her right and left; In the middle there was a wooden house with a mesonin, a red roof and dark gray or, better, wild walls-a house like those, as we are being built for military settlements and German colonists. It was noticeable that when building his architect was constantly struggling with the taste of the owner. The architect was a pedant and wanted symmetry, the owner - amenities and, apparently, due to that, it picked up on one side all the answering windows and the verifier in place of their place, probably needed for dark closet. The pediment, too, did not occur in the middle of the house, no matter how the architect was fighting, because the owner ordered one column to throw out the side, and therefore not four columns found, but only three. The courtyard was surrounded by a strong and excessively thick wooden grate. The landowner seemed to be busy about strength. On the stables, sheds and kitchens, full -fledged and thick logs were used, determined by centuries -old standing. The rustic huts of men were also cut off on the marvel: there were no brick [30] walls, carved patterns and other undertakings, but everything was added tightly and properly. Even the well was put into such a strong oak, which only goes to the mills and on the ships. In a word, everything that he looked at, it was too placed, without a dump, in some strong and clumsy order. Rising to the porch, he noticed two faces who looked out of the window almost at the same time: female, in a cap, narrow, long as a cucumber, and male, round, wide, like Moldovan pumpkins, called hoglings from which balalaiki make two -stringed in Rus'. Light balalaikas, beauty and fun of a seized twenty -year -old guy, migachis and dandy, and winking and whistling on the white -breasted and white -haired girls who were about to listen to his quiet trunks. Looking around, both faces hid at the same moment. A footman in a gray jacket with a blue standing collar went out onto the porch and introduced Chichikov into the canopy, where the owner himself had already come out. Seeing the guest, he said abruptly: "Please!" - And he led him into internal housing.

When Chichikov looked at Sobakevich, he this time seemed very similar to the medium -sized bear. To trust the similarity, the tailcoat on it was completely bearish color, the sleeves are long, the pantalons are long, he stepped with his feet and shouted and stepped incessantly on the legs of others. The complexion of the face had red -hot, hot, which happens on a copper heel. It is known that there are many such persons in the world, over the separation of which the nature did not have been wiser for long, did not use any small tools, once: files, bums and other things, but simply chopped from her shoulder: she had enough times-she went out his nose, grabbed the other in another - their lips came out, she picked her eyes with a large drill and, not slipping, let her into the light, saying: “Lives!” Sobakevich was the same strong and in a marvelous image: he held him more down than up, his neck did not turn at all and, due to such a scent, rarely looked at the one with whom he spoke, but always either at the corner of the stove, or at the door . Chichikov looked at him again when they passed the dining room: a bear! Perfect bear! Such a strange rapprochement is needed: his name was even called Mikhail Semenovich. Knowing his habit to step on his feet, he very carefully moved his and gave him the way forward. The owner seemed to feel this sin behind him and asked the same hour: "Didn't I disturb you?" But Chichikov thanked, saying that there was no concern yet.

Entering the living room, Sobakevich pointed to the chairs, saying again: "Please!" Sitting, Chichikov looked at the walls and at the paintings hanging on them. In the paintings, everything was well done, all Greek commanders, engraved to their full height: Mavroordato in red pantalons and uniforms, with glasses on the nose, miauli, Canari. [31] All these heroes were with such thick thighs and unheard of mustache that the trembling passed through the body. Between strong Greeks, it is not known how and for what, Bagration, skinny, thin, with small banners and guns below and in the most narrow frames, fit. Then again the heroine of the Greek Bobelina followed, [32] of which one leg seemed the most torso of the dandies that the current living rooms filled. The owner, being a healthy and strong man himself, seemed to be like his room was also decorated with strong and healthy people. Near Bobelina, at the very window, a cage hung, from which a dark -colored thrush with white specks looked, very similar to Sobakevich. The guest and the owner did not have time to shut up for two minutes, the door in the living room opened and the hostess entered, the lady is very tall, in a cap with ribbons repainted by domestic kraska. She came in degree, holding her head straight, like a palm tree.

- This is my Feudulia Ivanovna! - said Sobakevich.

Chichikov approached the handle of Feudulia Ivanovna, which she almost shoved on his lips, and he had the opportunity to notice that his hands were washed by a cucumber brine.

“Dushy, I recommend you,” continued Sobakevich, “Pavel Ivanovich Chichikov!” The governor and postmaster had the honor of getting to know each other.

Feudulia Ivanovna asked to sit down, saying too: "Please!" - And having made a movement of the head, like actresses representing Korolev. Then she sat down on the couch, covered with her merino scarf and no longer moved either an eye or an eyebrow.

Chichikov again raised his eyes up and again saw Canari with thick thighs and endless mustache, bobelin and thrush in the cage.

For almost five minutes, all remained silent; There was only a knock produced by the nose of the tree on the tree of a wooden cage, at the bottom of which it wasusing bread grains. Chichikov once again cast a room, and everything that was in it was all firmly, clumsily in the highest extent and had some strange similarity with the owner of the house himself; In the corner of the living room there was a pot -bellied walnut bureau on the pre -old four legs, a perfect bear. The table, armchairs, chairs - everything was the most heavy and restless properties - in a word, every object, every chair seemed to say: “And I am also dog!” Or: "And I am also very similar to Sobakevich!"

“We remembered you about the Chairman of the Chamber, from Ivan Grigoryevich,” Chichikov finally said, seeing that no one was located to start a conversation, “last Thursday.” Very pleasantly spent there.

“Yes, I was not at the chairman then,” answered Sobakevich.

- And a wonderful person!

- Who it? - said Sobakevich, looking at the corner of the furnace.

- Chairman.

- Well, maybe it seemed to you that: he was just a Mason, and such a fool that the light did not produce.

Chichikov was a little puzzled by such a sharp definition, but then, recovering, he continued:

- Of course, every person is not without weaknesses, but the governor is what an excellent person!

- Governor is an excellent person?

- Yes, isn't it?

- The first robber in the world!

- How, governor of the robber? - said Chichikov and at all could not understand how the governor could get into the robbers. “I admit, I wouldn’t think that,” he continued. “But let me, however, note: his actions are completely different, on the contrary, rather, even softness in him.” - Then he cited even wallets embroidered with his own hands in proof, and responded with praise on his affectionate expression on his face.

- And the face is robber! - said Sobakevich. - Give him only a knife and release him on a large road - cut, will cut for a penny! He and even the vice-governor is Goga and Magoga! [33]

“No, he is not in the ways with them,” Chichikov thought to himself. “But I’ll talk to him about the police officer: he seems to be his friend.”

“However, what is before me,” he said, “I admit, I like the police officer most of all.” Some kind of nature is straight, open; Something simple-hearted is visible in the face.

- Scammer! - said Sobakevich very coldly, - he will sell, deceive, will also have lunch with you! I know them all: these are all scammers, the whole city there is this: a fraudster on a fraudster sits and is driving a fraudster. All Christ -Socialist. One there is a decent person there: a prosecutor; Yes, and that, if you tell the truth, a pig.

After such commendable, although Chichikov saw several brief biographies that there was nothing to mention other officials, and remembered that Sobakevich did not like to speak well of anyone.

“Well, darling, let's go dinner,” his wife told Sobakevich.

- Ask! - said Sobakevich.

Supply, approaching the table, where there was a snack, the guest and the owner drank properly on the glass of vodka, bit how the whole of lengthy Russia is bite to the cities and villages, that is, all sorts of salins and other exciting grades, and everything flowed into the dining room; Ahead of them, like a smooth goose, the hostess rushed. A small table was set on four devices. In fourth place appeared very soon, it is difficult to say in the affirmative who, a lady or girl, relative, householder or just living in the house: something without a cap, about thirty years old, in a variegated scarf. There are persons who exist in the world not as an object, but as extraneous specks or spots on the subject. They sit in the same place, hold their heads equally, they are almost ready to take the furniture and think that the word has not yet come out of such lips; And somewhere in the girl or in the pantry it will be simple: wow!

- Sheath, my soul, today are very good! - said Sobakevich, having sipped by a swing and dumping a huge piece of a nanny from a dish, a well -known dish that is served to the holes and consists of a lamb stomach filled with buckwheat porridge, brain and legs. “A kind of nanny,” he continued, turning to Chichikov, “you won’t eat in the city, there the devil knows what they will give!”

“The governor is at, however, the table is not for,” said Chichikov.

- Yes, do you know what it is all prepared from? You will not eat when you find out.

- I don’t know how it is prepared, I can’t judge this, but pork cutlets and a boletus fish were excellent.

- It seemed to you that. After all, I know what they buy in the market. That Canal of the cook will buy that, who has learned from the Frenchman, the cat, wrap him, and gives him to the table instead of a hare.

- Ugh! What kind of trouble you say, ”said Sobakevich's wife.

- Well, darling, so they are doing it, I’m not to blame, so they all do it. All that is not unnecessary, that the shark abandones us, with permission to say, into the garbage dump, they are in the soup! Yes to the soup! there!

- You will always tell you at the table! - objected again the wife of Sobakevich.

“Well, my soul,” said Sobakevich, “if I did it myself, but I’ll tell you directly in your eyes that I won’t eat nasty things.” I wake me a frog at least with sugar, I won’t take it in my mouth, and I won’t take the oysters either: I know what oyster is like. Take the ram, ”he continued, turning to Chichikov,“ this is Barani's side with porridge! ” These are not the fricasa that are made in lamb kitchens from lamb, which days are four in the market! This was all invented by the doctors of the Germans and the French, I would outweigh them for it! We invented a diet, treat in hunger! That they have a German liquid nature, so they imagine that they sweet with the Russian stomach! No, this is not that, it's all fiction, that's all ... - here Sobakevich even shook his head angrily. - Interpret: enlightenment, enlightenment, and this enlightenment is Fuck! Another word would say, but just at the table is indecent. I'm not like that. When I have a pork - let's go on the table, lamb - the whole ram drash, goose - the whole goose! Better I eat two dishes, but I eat in moderation, as the soul requires. - Sobakevich confirmed this with a business: he knocked over half the lamb side to his plate, ate everything, gnawed, sucked to the last bone.

“Yes,” thought Chichikov, “this lip is not a fool.”

“It’s wrong for me,” said Sobakevich, wiping his hand with a napkin, “I don’t have the same as some Plyushkin: I have eight hundred souls, but lives and dines worse than my shepherd!”

- Who is this Plyushkin? - asked Chichikov.

“Fraud,” answered Sobakevich. - Such a bunch, which is difficult to imagine. In prison, wells live better than he: he crumbled all people with hunger.

- Really! - Picked up with the participation of Chichikov. “And you say that he, for sure, is dying in large numbers?”

- Like flies dumb.

- Really like flies! And let me ask how far he lives from you?

- Five miles.

- Five miles! - exclaimed Chichikov and even felt a small heartbeat. “But if you leave your gate, will it be right or left?”

“I don’t even advise you to know the road to this dog!” - said Sobakevich. -Excusive to go to some obscene place than to him.

“No, I asked not for any, but because I am interested in the knowledge of all kinds of places,” Chichikov answered this.

The lamb was followed by cheesecakes, of which each had much more plates, then a turkey tall in a calf, full of all kinds of good: eggs, rice, liver and ahead, that everything laid lumpy in the stomach. This lunch ended; But when they got up from the table, Chichikov felt the severity of the whole pood in himself. We went to the living room, where jam was already on a saucer - neither a pear, nor a plum, nor other berry, to which, however, neither the guest nor the owner touched. The hostess went out in order to lay him on and on other saucers. Taking advantage of her absence, Chichikov turned to Sobakevich, who, lying in his armchairs, only grunted after such a hearty dinner and made out some slurred sounds, baptized and closing in everyday hand with his hand. Chichikov turned to him with these words:

- I wanted to talk to you about one business.

“Here's another jam,” said the hostess, returning with a saucer, “radish boiled in honey!”

- And here we are after! - said Sobakevich. - You now go to your room, Pavel Ivanovich and I will Sk the Thracks, we will take a little rest!

The hostess had already expressed his readiness to send for down jackets and pillows, but the owner said: “Nothing, we will rest in the chairs,” and the hostess left.

Sobakevich a little lugged his head, preparing to hear what the businessman was.

Chichikov began somehow very remotely, touched the whole Russian state in general and responded with a great praise about its space, said that even the most ancient Roman monarchy was not so great, and foreigners rightly surprised ... Sobakevich listened, bending his head. And that according to the existing provisions of this state, in glory to which there is no equal, the auditory souls, having completed the field of life, are listed, but, before the presentation of the new Revisy fairy tale along with the living, so as not to burden the places attended by many petty and useless references and not increase The complexity of the already very complex state mechanism ... Sobakevich listened to everything, tilting his head, and that, however, with all the fairness of this measure, it can be partially burdened for many owners, obliging them to combine taxes as if for a living object, and That he, feeling personal respect for him, would be ready to even partially take on this really difficult duty. As for the main object of Chichikov, he expressed himself very carefully: he did not call the soul the dead, but only non -existent.

Sobakevich listened to everything as before, bending his head, and at least something similar to the expression appeared on his face. It seemed that there was no soul in this body at all, or he had it, but not where it should be, but, like the immortal Koshchei, somewhere around the mountains and was closed with such a thick shell that everything that did not turn on the bottom She did not decisively make any shock on the surface.

“So? ..” said Chichikov, waiting not without some excitement of the answer.

- Do you need dead souls? - Sobakevich asked very simply, without the slightest surprise, how would it be about bread.

“Yes,” Chichikov answered, and again softened the expression, adding: “Non -existing ones.”

“There will be why not to be ...” said Sobakevich.

- And if there are, then you, no doubt ... will it be pleasant to get rid of them?

“Well up, I’m ready to sell,” said Sobakevich, already raising his head somewhat and realizing that the buyer, right, should have any benefits here.

“Damn it,” Chichikov thought to himself, “this one is already selling before I hinted!” - and said aloud:

- And, for example, what about the price? Although, however, this is such an object ... that the price is even strange ...

- Yes, so as not to request from you too much, on the steps of rubles apiece! - said Sobakevich.

- On the chair! - cried Chichikov, losing his mouth and looking into his eyes, not knowing whether he rustled himself, or Sobakevich’s tongue in his heavy nature, not so turning, blurted out the other word instead of one.

“Well, is it expensive for you?” - said Sobakevich and then added: - And what, however, your price?

- My price! True, we somehow mistaken or do not understand each other, forgot what the subject consists of. I believe, for my part, it is on my heart: eight hryvnias per soul, this is the redest price!

- EC where they had enough - eight hryvnias!

- Well, by my judgment, as I think, it is no longer possible.

- After all, I am selling not bast shoes.

“However, you will agree yourself: after all, this is also not people.”

“So you think, will you find such a fool who would sell you through a two -war revision soul?”

“But let me: why do you call them revise, because the souls have already died the very long time, the sound that was intangible with feelings remained.” However, in order not to be included in further conversations on this part, one and a half rubles, if I will, I will give it, but I can no longer.

“You're ashamed of you and say such an amount!” You bargain, say a real price!

“I can’t, Mikhail Semenovich, believe my conscience, I can’t: what it’s impossible to do, it’s impossible to do it,” said Chichikov, but he still added a half.

- Why are you skimp? - said Sobakevich. - Right, inexpensive! Another fraudster will deceive you, sell you rubbish, not souls; And I have a vigorous nut, all for the selection: not a craftsman, so some kind of healthy man. You will consider: here, for example, Barban Mikheev! After all, he did not do any more crews as soon as spring. And it’s not how Moscow work happens, that for one hour - such a strength will generalize and cover it with varnish!

Chichikov opened his mouth in order to notice that Mikheev, however, has not been in the world for a long time; But Sobakevich entered, as they say, in the very power of speech, where the lynx and the gift of the word came from:

- And the traffic jam Stepan, carpenter? I will prostrate my head if you find such a man where you find. After all, what kind of strength was! He served in the guard, God would know what they gave, three arshins with a top of growth!

Chichikov again wanted to notice that there was no traffic jam in the world; But Sobakevich, apparently, carried: such flows of speeches poured that it was only necessary to listen to:

- Milushkin, brick! Could put the stove in any house. Maxim Telyatnikov, shoemaker: that he is stabbing, then boots, what boots, then thanks, and at least in the hoppy mouth. And Eremey Sorokoplykhin! Yes, this man will be alone for everyone, traded in Moscow, brought one frying one to five hundred rubles. After all, what a people! This is not that some Plyushkin will sell you.

“But let me,” said Chichikov, amazed by such a plentiful flood of speeches, which, it seemed, had no end, “why are you calculating all their qualities, because now there is no sense in them, because this is all dead people.” At least a fence, say a dead body, says the proverb.

“Yes, of course, the dead,” said Sobakevich, as if thinking up and recalling that they were really dead, and then added: “However, and then to say: what of these people who are now listed as living?” What are these people? Flies, not people.

- Yes, they still exist, but this is a dream.

- Well, no, not a dream! I will report to you what Mikheev was, so you do not find such people: the machine is such that this room will not enter; No, this is not a dream! And in his shoulders he had such a silver that a horse did not have; I would like to know where you would find such a dream in another place!

He already said the last words, turning to the walls of Bagration and Kolokotroni, [34] as usual, as it usually happens when one of them suddenly, it is not known why, will turn to the face to which the words belong to, but to some Inadvertently coming to the third, even completely unfamiliar, from whom he knows that he will not hear any answer, opinion, nor confirmation, but on which, however, he will rush his eyes as if he was calling him for intermediaries; And somewhat mixed in the first minute does not know whether to answer him the case that he had not heard of, or to stand up so, observing the proper decency, and then go away.

“No, I can’t give more than two rubles,” said Chichikov.

- If you please, so that they do not claim to me, that I ask you expensive and I do not want to do any favor, if you please - seventy -five rubles per soul, only by banknotes, right, only for acquaintance!

“What is he really,” Chichikov thought to himself, “for a fool, or something, takes me?” - and then added aloud:

-It is strange to me, the right: it seems that there is some kind of theatrical performance or comedy between us, otherwise I cannot explain to myself ... You seem to be a rather smart person, you own information of education. After all, the subject is just fu-fu. What is he standing? who needs?

- Yes, you are buying, therefore, you need it.

Here Chichikov bit his lip and did not find what to answer. He began to talk about some family and family circumstances, but Sobakevich answered simply:

- I do not need to know what the relationship you have; I am not interfered with family affairs, this is your business. You needed souls, I sell to you, and you will repent that you did not buy.

“Two rubles,” said Chichikov.

- Ek, right, hardened the forty Jacob one about everyone, as the proverb says; As they established two, you don’t want to move out from them. You give a real price!

“Well, damn him,” Chichikov thought to himself, “I will add to him in half a thousand, a dog, for nuts!”

- Please, I will add a half -tin.

- Well, please, and I will tell you my last word too: fifty rubles! Right, a loss to yourself, cheaper you do not buy such a good people anywhere!

"Esko Fist!" - Chichikov said to himself and then continued out loud with some annoyance:

- But what is really ... as if precisely a sueal business; Yes, I’ll take it in another place. Everyone will also hunt them with hunting, only to get rid of it as soon as possible. Will the fool really keep them with you and pay taxes for them!

-But you know that such purchases, I say this between us, by friendship, are not always permissible, and tell me or who else-there will be no power of attorney regarding contracts or joining any profitable obligations to such.

"You see, the kuda marks, the scoundrel!" - thought Chichikov and immediately said with the most cold -blooded look:

-As you want, I buy not for any need, as you think, but by the inclinations of my own thoughts. Two with half a thousand do not want - goodbye!

"You can’t get him, is not in arrogant!" - thought Sobakevich.

- Well, God is with you, let's thirty and take them to yourself!

- No, I see you do not want to sell, goodbye!

- Let me, let me! - said Sobakevich, not releasing his hand and stepping on his foot, for our hero forgot to beware, in punishment for which he should have hissed and jump on one leg.

- Sorry! I seem to have bore you. Create, sit here! Ask! - Here he put him in his chair with some dexterity, like such a bear that has already been in his hands, knows how to turn over, and make different things to the questions: “And show, Misha, how the women are soaring” or: “And how, Misha is Misha” do small guys steal peas? "

- Really, I spend time in vain, I need to hurry.

- Sit one minute, I will tell you one pleasant word for you now. - Then Sobakevich sat closer and told him quietly in his ear, as if a secret: - Do you want a corner?

- That is, twenty -five rubles? Neither, nor, even a quarter of the corner, I will not add a penny.

Sobakevich fell silent. Chichikov also fell silent. For two minutes silence lasted. Bagration with an eagle nose looked from the wall extremely carefully at this purchase.

- What is your last price? - finally said Sobakevich.

- Two with half a year.

- Really, your human soul is like a steamed turnip. Give at least three rubles!

- I can not.

- Well, nothing to do with you, if you please! A loss, yes the disposition is so dog: I can not help but give pleasure to the neighbor. After all, I am tea, you need to do the merchant, so that everything is in order.

- Of course.

-Well, the same, you will need to go to the city.

So the work happened. Both decided to be in the city tomorrow and manage with the merchant fortress. Chichikov asked for a list of peasants. Sobakevich agreed willingly and immediately approached the bureau, with his own hands began to write everyone out not only by name, but even with the meaning of commendable qualities.

And Chichikov began to do anything, being behind, by considering his whole spacious salary. As he looked at his back, wide, like Vyatka squat horses, and on his feet, riding the cast-iron cabins that they put on the sidewalks, could not but exclaim the inside: “Ec rewarded you with God! It’s for sure, as they say, it is uncommonly hidden, but it was firmly sewn! .. Have you been born like a bear, or was a provincial life, bread crops, fussing with men, and you have done what a bucket man has done? But no: I think you would all be the same, even if you even raised you in fashion, they would have started in play and you would live in St. Petersburg, and not in the background. The whole difference is that now you will finish the half-bank sides with porridge by biting the cheesecake in a plate, and then you would have eaten any cutlets with truffles. Yes, now you have men under the authorities: you are in Lada with them and, of course, you won’t offend them, because they are yours, you will be worse; And then you would have officials whom you would have snapped strongly, realizing that they are not your serfs, or would you rob the treasury! No! Who is already a fist, not to straighten into the palm of your hand! And flashed one or two fingers, it will get out even worse. Try it slightly the tops of some science, he will give it to know later, taking a visible place, to all those who really recognized some science. Yes, perhaps, he will say later: “Let me show myself!” Yes, this will invent a wise decree that many will have a solo ... Eh, if all the fists! .. ”

“The note is ready,” said Sobakevich, turning back.

- Ready? Get it here! - He ran through her eyes and marveled at accuracy and accuracy: not only the craft, the title, summer and family condition were spelled out thoroughly, but even in the fields there were special marks about behavior, sobriety - in a word, there was a lot to look.

- Now please please the same task! - said Sobakevich.

- Why do you have a set? You will receive all the money in the city at one time.

“Everything, you know, is that it,” said Sobakevich.

“I don’t know how to give you, I did not take money with me.” Yes, there are ten rubles.

- Well, ten! Give, at least fifty!

Chichikov began to dissuade that no; But Sobakevich said so in the affirmative that he has money, that he took out a piece of paper, saying:

“Perhaps here are fifteen for you, total twenty -five.” Please only a receipt.

- Why do you need a receipt?

- Everything, you know, is better than a receipt. An hour is not even, everything can happen.

- Well, give the money here!

- What is the money? Here they are in my hand! As soon as you write a receipt, you will take them at the same minute.

- Yes, let me, how can I write a receipt? First you need to see money.

Chichikov released Sobakevich from his hands, who, approaching the table and covering them with his left hand with his fingers, wrote on another patch of papers that he received a deposit of twenty -five rubles for sold souls in full. Having written a note, he reviewed the banknotes again.

-The paper is old! - He said, examining one of them in the world, - a little torn, but there is nothing to look at it between friends.

“Fist, fist! - Chichikov thought to himself, - and even the beast in addition! "

- Would you like a female?

- No, thank you.

- I would be inexpensive and took it. For acquaintance on the rubles apiece.

- No, I do not need the female field.

- Well, when you do not need, there is nothing to say. There is no law for tastes: whoever loves the priest, and whoever is the way, says the proverb.

“I also wanted to ask you to stay between us,” said Chichikov, saying goodbye.

- Yes, of course. There is nothing to interfere here; What happens in sincerity between short friends, should remain in their mutual friendship. Farewell! Thank you for visiting; I ask and do not forget: if a free hour will get out, come to have lunch, spend time. Maybe it will happen again to serve with each other.

“Yes, no matter how! - Chichikov thought to himself, sitting down in a brown. - Two with half a year tore off for a dead soul, damn fist! ”

He was dissatisfied with the behavior of Sobakevich. Still, be that as it may, the person is familiar, both the governor and the police officer saw, but acted as if completely alien, he took the money for rubbish! When the Brichka left the yard, he looked back and saw that Sobakevich was still standing on the porch and, as it seemed, looked closely, wanting to know where the guest would go.

- A scoundrel, still worth it! He said through his teeth and ordered Selifan, turning to peasant huts, to drive away so that it was impossible to see the crew from the master's court. He wanted to call in to Plyushkin, who, according to Sobakevich, people died like flies, but did not want Sobakevich to know about it. When the Brichka was already at the end of the village, he called the first man to him, who, having fallen somewhere on the road, dragged him on his shoulder, like a tireless ant to his hut.

- Hey beard! And how to get from here to Plyushkin, so that not past the master's house?

The man seemed to be difficult for this question.

- Well, you don't know?

“No, Barin, I don't know.”

- Oh you! And the gray hair still turned! Blagushka Plyushkina do not know what does not feed people badly?

- A! paid, paid! - cried out the man.

He also added a noun to the word “paid”, very successful, but improving in a secular conversation, and therefore we will miss it. However, one can guess that it was expressed very accurately, because Chichikov, although the man had long disappeared from sight and left a lot, but still grinned, sitting in a brown. The Russian people are strongly expressed! And if he rewards someone in a word, then it will go to his family and offspring, he will drag him with him and to the service, and resigned, and in St. Petersburg, and to the ends of the world. And then no later the cunning or ennoble your nickname, at least make the people who write people take him out of the hired fee from the ancient -mesh family, nothing will help: the nickname in all its crow's throat rings for itself and will clearly say where the bird flew out of. The aptly pronounced, the same as written, is not cut off with an ax. And there is a accurately all that came out of the depths of Rus', where there are neither German, nor Chukhon, nor any other tribes, but all the samorod itself, a lively and lively Russian mind, which does not climb into his pocket, does not hatch him Like a hen of chickens, and flows right away, like a pashport on an eternal toe, and there is nothing to add later, what your nose or lips is, you are outlined from head to toe with one line!

As a myriad of churches, monasteries with domes, chapters, crosses, scattered into the holy, pious Rus', so myriad of tribes, generations, peoples crowded, variegated and rushing about the face of the earth. And every people, which bears the key to the forces full of the abilities of the soul, its vivid feature and other gifts of God, distinguished each of their own word, which, expressing whatever the object, reflects in the expressing part of its own character. The heart of life will be responded with heart -heartedness and wise cognition of life; With a slight dandy, the short -lived word of the Frenchman will flash and the short -lived word; intricately invents his, not everyone accessible, smartly-sensible word German; But there is no word that would be so widening, briskly, so it burst from under the very heart, it would boil and burned like a well-said word.

Chapter six

Previously, for a long time, in the summer of my youth, in the summer of my childhood irrevocably flickered, I had fun to drive up for the first time to an unfamiliar place: it doesn’t matter if it was a village, a poor county town, a village, a village, - I opened a lot of curious in it Children's curious look. Any structure, everything that was only impressed by some noticeable feature-everything stopped me and amazed me. Is the stone house, a well-known architecture with a half of the false windows, one-single-legged stuck out among the log of the same-story philistine philistine houses, whether the correct dome, all upholstered by leaf white iron, ascended over the shirt, like snow, the new church, the market, the market, the market, the market Whether the county, which came among the city, was not slipped away from fresh subtle attention, and, having stuck my nose out of the camping cart of my, I looked at the cut of some kind of frock coat, and at wooden boxes with nails, with a gray, yellowed, yellowed. With raisins and soap, flashing from the doors of the vegetable shop, along with the banks of the dried Moscow confection, he also looked at the infantry officer who was going to the side of the infantry officer from which province to county boredom, and the merchant who flickered in the Siberian [35] on the running yeasts, And he was carried away mentally after them into their poor life. Country official pass by-I already thought: where does he go, for the evening to some of your brother or directly to his home, so that, sitting with half an hour on the porch, until the twilight is still thickened, to sit down for an early dinner with his mother , with his wife, with his wife’s sister and the whole family, and what they will have a conversation at a time when a courtyard girl in monists or a boy in a thick jacket will bring a sebaceous candle in a durable home candlestick after a soup. Rising to the village of some landowner, I curiously looked at the tall narrow wooden bell tower or a wide dark wooden old church. The red roof and the white pipes of the landlord house, and I waited impatiently through the woody greens, ramptled me, while I waited impatiently, while the gardens that stood up on both sides and it would seem to be all with its own, then, alas! I do not go at all, appearance; And on him I tried to guess who the landowner himself was, whether he was fat, and whether he had his sons, or as many as six daughters with a sonorous girlish laugh, games and an eternal beauty less sister, and whether they were, and whether he was a funny or frown Like September in recent days, he looks at the calendar and speaks about boring rye and wheat for youth.

Now I am indifferently approaching every unfamiliar village and indifferently I look at her vulgar appearance; It is not possible for my chilled eyes, it’s not funny to me, and what would awaken in the previous years a living movement in the face, laughter and nonsense speeches, it now slides past, and indifferent silence keep my motionless mouth. Oh my youth! Oh my freshness!

While Chichikov thought and internally laughed at the nickname, Plyushkin’s men released, he did not notice how he drove into the middle of an extensive village with many huts and streets. Soon, however, he let him notice this science shock produced by a log bridge, before which the city stone was nothing. These logs, like piano keys, rose up, then down, and a non -inherent riding acquired either a bump on the back of the head, or a blue spot on the forehead, or it happened to bite off the tail of its own tongue with its own teeth. He noticed some special dilapidation on all rural buildings: the log on the huts was dark and old; Many roofs showed like a sieve; On others, only the horse and poles remained at the sides in the form of ribs. It seems that the owners themselves demolished from them Dranier and Tes, reasoning, and, of course, it is fair that the huts do not cover in the rain, and there is no capture in the bucket, but there is no need to bake in it when there is a scope in a tavern and on a large the road, in a word, wherever you want. The windows in the huts were without glasses, others were shut up with a rag or zipun; The balconies under the roofs with railings, it is not known for what reasons they made in other Russian huts squinted and turned black not even picturesque. Due to the huts, huge layers of bread stretched in many places in rows, stagnant, apparently, for a long time; They looked like the old, poorly scorched brick, all sorts of rubbish grew at the top, and even a bush was clung to the side. The bread, apparently, was the Lord. Because of the bread cranes and dilapidated roofs, they rang out and flickered in clean air, then on the right, then on the left, as the Brick made turns, two rural churches, one near the other: empty wooden and stone, with yellow walls, stacked, expired. The master’s house began to be depressed in parts and finally glanced all in the place where the hut chain was interrupted and their vegetable garden or cabbage, surrounded by low, in places broken city, remained empty. With some decrepit disabled, this strange castle looked, long, long exorbitantly. In places he was on one floor, in places in two; On a dark roof, not everywhere reliably defending his old age, two Belvederes stuck out, one against the other, both already shaken, deprived of the colors that once covered them. The walls of the house stirred up a naked plaster lattice and, as you can see, suffered a lot from all bad weather, rains, whirlwinds and autumn changes. From the windows, only two were open, the others were forced by shutters or even clogged with boards. These two windows, for their part, were also blind; On one of them, a glued triangle made of blue sugar paper darkened.

The old, vast, stretching around the house, went beyond the village and then disappeared into the field, overgrown and stalled, it seemed that one refreshed this vast village and one was quite picturesque in his picture emptying. Green clouds and irregular trepolite dome lay on the heavenly horizon, the connected peaks of trees overgrown at large. The white colossal barrel of birch, devoid of the top, fragmented by a storm or thunderstorm, rose from this green thlyough and circled in the air, like a proper marble sparkling column; A slanting pointed fragment of him, with which he ended up instead of the capitals, was dark on his snowy whiten like a hat or a black bird. The hops, the busies, mountain ash and a hazel -off bushes dramatically and then ran at the top of the entire picket fence, finally ran up up and wrapped up a broken birch to half. Having reached its middle, he hung down from there and began to cling to the tops of other trees or hung in the air, tied his thin tenacious hooks, easily vibranted by air with rings. In places, green thickets diverged, illuminated by the sun, and showed an induced depression between them, gaping like a dark mouth; It was all overwhelmed by a shadow, and slightly flashed in the black depth of it: a running narrow path, a collapsed railing, a shaken arbor, a dummy decrepit trunk of willow, a gray-haired chapel, [36] with a thick stubble, which was exhausted from a terrible muffle, froze from a terrible gulf, fried from a terrible gulp, wrinkled. And the crossed leaves and branches, and, finally, the young branch of the maple, which extended to the side of its green paws, under one of which, having climbed God the news, the Sun suddenly turned it into a transparent and fiery, miraculously shining in this thick darkness. In the direction, at the very edge of the garden, several tall, not flush to others, the aspen raised huge raven of the nests on their reverent peaks. In other of them, the drew and not completely separated branches hung down with dry leaves. In a word, everything was good, how to not invent either nature or art, but as it happens only when they connect together, when nature, often to no avail, will be the final cutter, will facilitate heavy masses, destroy the rough correctness and the work of a person, and it will be completely incomprehensible and the work of a person. The beggarly gaps, through which the unexpressed, naked plan will be visible, and will give wonderful warmth to everything that was created in the cola of measured purity and neatness.

Having made one or two turns, our hero finally found himself in front of the house, which now seemed even sadder. Green mold has already covered a dilapidated tree on the fence and gates. A crowd of buildings: human, barns, cellars, apparently dilapidated - filled the courtyard; Near them to the right and left, the gates were visible to other yards. Everyone said that here once the farm flowed in a vast size, and everything was now cloudy. It was not noticeable that the painting was not noticeable: neither the open doors, nor the people out, no living troubles and worries at home! Only one main gate was dissolved, and then because a man entered with a loaded body, covered with rogue, which seemed to be deliberately to revive this extinct place; At another time, they were locked tightly, for the castle-assel hung in the iron loop. At one of the buildings, Chichikov soon noticed some figure that began to recycled with a man who arrived in a cart. For a long time he could not recognize what kind of floor the figure was: a woman or a man. The dress on her was completely uncertain, similar to a female hood, on her head, which is worn by the village courtyard women, only one voice seemed to him somewhat sipper for a woman. “Oh, Baba! - He thought to himself and immediately added: "Oh, no!" - "Of course, Baba!" He finally said, examining more later. The figure, on his part, looked at him also intently. It seemed that the guest was a curiosity for her, because she examined not only him, but also Selifan and horses, from the tail to the face. According to her keys hanging behind her belt and by the fact that she scolded a man with rather diarrhea words, Chichikov concluded that this is true, a key house.

“Listen, mother,” he said, leaving the Brichka, “what is the master? ..

“There is no house,” the keychain interrupted, without waiting for the end of the issue, and then, a minute later, added: “What do you need?”

- There is a thing!

- Go to the rooms! - said the keychain, extinguished and showing him his back, stained with flour, with a large sence lower.

He entered the dark wide canopy, from which it blew with cold, like from a cellar. From the canopy, he fell into the room, also a dark, slightly illuminated light, emerging from under the wide gap, which was at the bottom of the door. Having opened this door, he finally found himself in the light and was amazed at the same mess. It seemed as if the floors were washing in the house and all the furniture had been piled here for a while. There was even a broken chair on one table, and next to it the clock with the stopped pendulum, to which the spider has already set the web. Immediately stood a closet leaned sideways against the wall with ancient silver, decanters and Chinese porcelain. On Bure, laid out by mother of pearl mosaic, which already fell out in places and left behind some yellow grooves filled with glue, lay a lot of all sorts of things: a bunch of small pieces of paper, covered with marble, green press with an egg upstairs, some old leather binding book with red with a cut, a lemon, all the dried-up, no more than a wooden nut, a torn handle of armchairs, a glass with a liquid and three flies, covered with a letter, a piece of marigold, a piece of somewhere raised rag, two pen, stained with ink, dried up like in The consumption, a toothpick, completely yellowed, to which the owner, perhaps, was picking his teeth even before the invasion of the French to Moscow.

Several paintings were hung on the walls very closely and stupidly: a long yellowed engravings of some battle, with huge drums, screaming soldiers in triangular hats and drowning horses, without glass, inserted into a red tree frame with thin bronze stripes and bronze circles in the corners in the corners in the corners . A huge blackened picture, painted with oil paints, depicting flowers, fruits, cuts, boar muzzle and a duck hanging down, took half -manned with them. From the middle of the ceiling, a chandelier hung in a canvas bag, from the dust made like a silk cocoon in which the worm sits. In the corner of the room, a bunch of what was more loaded and that it was unworthy to lie on the tables was covered on the floor. It was difficult to solve what exactly was in a heap, for dust on it was in such abundance that the hands of any one concerned became like gloves; More noticeably, more noticeable from there a torn piece of a wooden shovel and an old sole of the boot protruded. It could not have been said that a living creature lived in this room if the old, well -worn cap, lying on the table, had not announced his stay. While he was considering all the strange decoration, the side door opened and the same key warehouse rose that he met in the yard. But then he saw that it was more like a keyhouse than a key holder: the key holder, at least, did not shave his beards, and this one, on the contrary, was shaved, and it seemed quite rarely, because the whole chin with the lower part of his cheek was like him On a scraper of iron wire, which is cleaned on the stable of horses. Chichikov, having given a questioning expression to his face, expected with impatience that the keyboy wanted to tell him. The Klyuchnik, too,, on his part, expected Chichikov to tell him. Finally, the last, surprised by such a strange bewilderment, decided to ask:

- What is the master? At home, or what?

“The owner is here,” said the Klyuchnik.

- Where? - repeated Chichikov.

-What, father, blind, or what? The Klyuchnik asked. - Echo! And the owner is!

Here our hero involuntarily stepped back and looked at him intently. He happened to see a lot of all kinds of people, even such as the reader with the reader, perhaps, will never have to be seen; But he has not yet seen this. His face was nothing special; It was almost the same as many thin old people, one chin only spoke very far ahead, so that he had to close it with a handkerchief every time so as not to swim; Small eyes had not yet gone out and ran from under the high eyebrows, like mice, when, having stuck out of the dark nickel muzzles, a quarrel of ears and blinking a mustache, they look out whether the cat or the shawl of the boy was lurking, and smoke suspiciously the air most suspiciously. His outfit was much more remarkable: no means and starters could not get to the bottom of what his dressing gown was concocted from: the sleeves and the upper floors were so grew and froze that they were like Juft, [37] which was going on boots; In instead of two, the Nazadi dangled four floors, from which cotton paper climbed with ocher. On his neck, he also tied something that could not be disassembled: whether the stocking, whether the garter, or a nabrushnik, was not a tie in any way. In a word, if Chichikov met him, so tied, somewhere at the church doors, he would probably give him a copper penny. For to the honor of our hero it must be said that his heart was compassionate and he could not resist, so as not to give a copper penny to the poor man. But before him stood not a beggar, a landowner stood before him. This landowner had a thousand with a liner of souls, and someone would have tried to find so much bread with grain, flour and just in cranes, who would have pantries, barns and dryers [38] were cluttered with so many canvases, cloths, sheepskin and cheese -cheese -cheese , dried fish and all kinds of vegetables, or a bastard. [39] Someone would look at his workshop, where it was prepared for the supply of any tree and dishes that had never been used-it would seem to him if he somehow got to Moscow to the brush courtyard, where the quick mother-in-law and mother-in-law were sent daily and Beetroots, with cooks behind, make their own reserves and where any tree whits - sewn, chilled, bastard and woven: barrels, cross, ears, lagoon, [40] Zhbans with stubborn, twincs, baskets, buttonholes, [40] 41] Where the women put their lobes and other squabbles, a box of thin bent aspen, storms of woven birch bark and a lot of things that go to rich and poor Rus'. What would it seem to be needed by Plyushkin such the death of such products? Throughout my life, they would not even have to use them for two such estates as he had - but this seemed to him few. Not content with Sim, he walked every day along the streets of his village, looked under the bridges, under the crossbars and everything that he came across: the old sole, grandmother rag, iron nail, clay cherries - all dragged to his pile that Chichikov noticed in the corner of the room. "There was already a fisherman on hunting!" - the men said when they saw him, going to prey. And in fact, after him there was no need for revenge: the passing officer had happened to lose the spur, this spur instantly went to a well -known pile; If the woman, somehow gallowing at the well, blessed a bucket, he dragged a bucket and a bucket. However, when the remarkable man convicted him right there, he did not argue and gave the stolen thing; But if only she fell into a heap, then it was all over: he was afraid that his thing was bought by him then, from this or got it from his grandfather. In his room, he lifted everything that he saw from the floor: a marigchik, a shred of paper, a feather, and all this put at the bureau or on the window.

But there was a time when he was only a frugal master! A family man was married, and a neighbor traveled to him to dine, listen and learn from him by the economy and wise stinginess. Everything flowed vividly and was performed by a measured move: mills, felts moved, cloth factories, carpentry, and locks worked; Everywhere, everything was included in the keen gaze of the owner and, like a hardworking spider, ran troublesome, but with a quick, at all ends of his economic web. Too strong feelings were not reflected in his facial features, but the mind was visible in his eyes; The experience and knowledge of the light was imbued with his speech, and the guest was pleased to listen to him; The friendly and talkative mistress was famous for the bakery; Two pretty daughters, both blond and fresh, like roses; A son, a broken boy, ran out, and kissed everyone, paying little attention to whether or was not happy to or was not happy to do this. All the windows were opened in the house, the mezzanine was occupied by the Teacher-French, who was gloriously shaved and there was a large shooter: he always brought wretches or ducks to dinner, and sometimes only sparrow eggs from which he ordered his fried egg, because more in the house in the whole house No one ate her. On the mezzanines, his component, a mentor of two girls, also lived on the mezzanines. The owner himself appeared to the table in a frock coat, although somewhat well -worn, but neat, the elbows were in order: there is no patch anywhere. But the good mistress died; Part of the keys, and with them minor worries, passed to him. Plyushkin became more restless and, like all widowers, more suspicious and mean. He could not rely on the eldest daughter Alexander Stepanovna, and he was right, because Alexandra Stepanovna soon fled with the headquarters of the trap, God the news of which cavalry regiment, and married him somewhere hastily in the village church, knowing that her father He does not like officers in a strange prejudice, as if all military cardigors and motors. Father sent a curse on her road, but did not care about pursue. The house became even empty. The owner began to be more noticeable in the owner, flashing his gray hair in the hard hair, her faithful friend, helped her to develop even more; The French teacher was released, because it was time for his son to serve; Madame was driven out, because she was not sinless in the abduction of Alexandra Stepanovna; The son, being sent to the provincial city, in order to find out in the ward, according to his father, the service was significant, was determined instead of that in the regiment and wrote to his father already by his definition, asking for money for uniforms; It is very natural that he received what is called in the native Shish. Finally, the last daughter, who remained with him in the house, died, and the old man found himself one watchman, the keeper and the ruler of her wealth. Lonely life gave a hearty food of stinginess, which, as you know, has a wolf hunger and the more devour, the more insatiable; Human feelings that were already not deep in him were Mellya every minute, and every day something was lost in this worn ruin. If it happened under such a minute, as if on purpose, in confirmation of his opinion about the military that his son was lost in cards; He sent him from the heart his father’s curse and was never interested in knowing whether he was in the world or not. Every year the windows in his house pretended, finally only two remained, of which one, as the reader had already seen, was sealed with paper; More and more the main parts of the economy went out of sight every year, and his petty look turned to the papers and the feathers that he collected in his room; He became more unavailable to the purchasers who came to pick up economic works from him; The purchasers bargained, bargained, and finally threw it at all, saying that it was a demon, not a person; Hay and bread rotted, putting and stacks turned into clean manure, even though they diluted cabbage on them, the flour in the basements turned into stone, and it was necessary to chop it, it was scary to touch the cloths, canvases and domestic matters: they turned into dust. He had already borne himself, how much he had, and remembered only in what place he stood in his closet with a decanter with the remainder of some kind of tincture, on which he himself made a tank so that no one would drink it with a thieves, but where the feather was lying Or Surgushchik. Meanwhile, the income was still gathering in the farm: the man had to bring the same amount to the same gap, any woman was lined with the same handups of nuts; The same number of canvas supplied the weaver, all this fell into the pantries, and everything became rot and gap, and he finally turned into some kind of gap on humanity. Alexandra Stepanovna once came two times with a little son, trying to get anything; It can be seen that the camping life with the headquarters of the trap was not so attractive as it seemed before the wedding. Plyushkin, however, forgave her and even gave her little granddaughter to play some button lying on the table, but gave nothing money. Another time, Alexandra Stepanovna arrived with two babies and brought him a cake to tea and a new robe, because the priest had such a dressing gown, which was not only ashamed to look at, but even ashamed. Plyushkin caressed both grandchildren and, putting them on one on his right knee, and the other on the left, shook them completely as if they were driving on horses, Kulich and the bathrobe took, but did not give his daughter anything resolutely; With that, Alexandra Stepanovna left.

So, this is what kind of landowner stood in front of Chichikov! I must say that such a phenomenon rarely comes across in Rus', where everything likes to turn around rather than to cringe, and all the more amazing it is that the landowner will immediately turn up in the neighborhood, who was in full width of the Russian delete and basism, burning, as they say, through his life. . An unprecedented passage will stop with amazement at the sight of his home, wondering what a sovereign prince was suddenly among the small, dark owners: his white stone houses with a countless many pipes, Belvedians, floods, surrounded by a herd of wovers and all sorts of premises for visiting guests are looking at the palaces. What does he have? Theaters, balls; The whole night shines with the lights and plots, announced by the thunder of music, the garden. Half -gungines are raised and cheerfully walking under the trees, and nobody is wild and threatening in this violent light, when a branch illuminated by its bright greenery is theatrically popped out of the woods with fake light, and it is darker, and more severely, and is twenty times more menacing through That night sky and, far from trembling with the leaves in the leaf, leaving deeper into unforgettable darkness, the harsh peaks of trees on this tinsel shine, which illuminated their roots from below, are indignant.

Plyushkin stood for several minutes, without saying a word, and Chichikov still could not start a conversation, entertained both by the view of the owner himself and all that was in his room. For a long time he could not figure out in what words to explain the cause of his visit. He already wanted to express himself in such a spirit that, having heard about the virtue and rare properties of his soul, he felt a duty to bring a tribute to respect, but he realized and felt that it was too much. I squinted in a look at everything that was in the room, he felt that the word “virtue” and “rare properties of the soul” could be successfully replaced by the words “savings” and “order”; And therefore, having transformed in this way, he said that, having heard about his savings and the rare management of estates, he felt for his duty to get acquainted and personally bring his respect. Of course, one could give a different, better reason, but then nothing else came to mind.

At this, Plyushkin muttered something through his lips, because there were no teeth, what exactly was unknown, but, probably, the meaning was: “But the devil with your reverence would have blessed you!” But since the hospitality is in such a way that the Blackshaga is not able to transgress his laws, he added a little more intelligently: “I ask you to submissively sit down!”

“I haven’t seen the guests for a long time,” he said, “yes, I must admit that I see little to use.” They started a neglected custom to go to each other, and in the household, there is an omission ... and their horses are fed with hay! I had long had a long time, and my kitchen is low, nasal, and the pipe completely fell apart: you will start drowning, you will make a fire.

“There it is! - Chichikov thought to himself. “It’s good that I intercepted the cheesecake and breaks of the lamb side by Sobakevich.”

- And such a nasty joke that hay is at least a tuft as a whole by the economy! - continued Plyushkin. - And in fact, how do you save him? The earth is small, the man is lazy, does not like to work, he thinks, as if in a tavern ... Look, you will go in old age around the world!

“However, they told me,” Chichikov modestly remarked, “that you have more than a thousand souls.”

- And who told that? And you would, Father, spat in the eyes of the one that told it! He, the mockingbird, apparently wanted to joke at you. Here, Bay, thousands of souls, but go, count, but you won’t start anything! For the past three years, the damned fever melted my hefty jackpot of men.

- Tell! and freezed a lot? - exclaimed Chichikov with participation.

- Yes, they demolished many.

- And let me find out: how many?

- Eighty shower.

- No?

- I will not lie, father.

- Let me ask again: after all, these souls, I believe, do you think from the day the last revision is submitted?

“It would still be glory to God,” said Plyushkin, “but there is more to get up to one hundred and twenty.”

- Really? As many as one hundred and twenty? - exclaimed Chichikov and even opened a few mouths with amazement.

- Star, father, to lie: the seventh dozen live! - said Plyushkin. He seemed to be offended by such an almost joyful exclamation. Chichikov noticed that in fact it was indecent such indifference to someone else's grief, and therefore sighed immediately and said that he would condole.

“Why, you won’t put condolences in your pocket,” said Plyushkin. - The captain lives near me; The devil knows him where he came from, says - a relative: "Uncle, uncle!" - And he kisses his hand, but how to condemn it, the howl will rise so that the ears are taking care. All red from the face: Pennika, tea, adheres to death. True, he lowered the money, serving in the officers, or the theater actress lured, so now he will condole!

Chichikov tried to explain that his condolences are not at all of the same kind as captain, and that he was not empty words, but is ready to prove him and, without delaying things further, without any offenses, immediately expressed his readiness to assume the obligation to pay taxes for all Peasants who died such accidents. The proposal seemed to be completely amazed at Plyushkin. He, staring his eyes, looked at him for a long time and finally asked:

- Yes, you, Father, did you serve in military service?

“No,” Chichikov answered quite slyly, “he served according to Statskaya.”

- According to the state? -Plyushkin repeated and began to chew his lips, as if he had eaten something. - Why? After all, this is at a loss to you yourself?

- For your pleasure, you are ready for a loss.

- Ah, father! Ah, my benefactor! - Plyushkin cried out, not noticing from the joy that his nose looked out of his nose, a sample of thick coffee, and the floors of the robe, opened, showed a dress, not very decent for examination. - Here they consoled the old man! Oh, my Lord! Ah, you are my saints! .. - Next, Plyushkin could not speak. But not even a minute had passed, like this joy, which was so instantly appeared on his wooden face, also instantly passed, as if it had not happened at all, and his face again took a caring expression. He even wiped himself with a handkerchief and, turning it into a lump, began to carry himself on his upper lip.

- How, with your permission, so as not to angry you, you will take to pay for them in every year? And will you give the money to me or to the treasury?

- Yes, we’ll do how to do it: we will make a merchant fortress on them, as if they were alive and how would you sell them to me.

“Yes, the merchant fortress ...” said Plyushkin, thought and began to eat his lips again. - After all, here is the merchant fortress - all the costs. The orders are so shameless! Before, it happened that you will get off with a bag of flour, and now you went a whole cart of cereals, and add a red piece of paper, such a fraud! I do not know how priests do not pay attention to this; I would say some teaching: after all, whatever you say, but you can’t solve God against the word.

"Well, you, I think, you will be aimed!" - Chichikov thought to himself and said right there that, out of respect for him, he was ready to take even the costs of the merchant at his own expense.

Hearing that he even takes on the costs of the merchant, Plyushkin concluded that the guest should be completely stupid and only pretends to be serving in the state, and, correctly, he was in officers and dragged him for acting. For all that, he, however, could not hide his joy and wished all the comforts not only to him, but even to his children, without asking whether he had him or not. He approached the window, he tapped his fingers into the glass and shouted: "Hey Proshka!" After a minute, one could hear that someone ran in a habit in the canopy, fought there for a long time and knocked out with boots, finally the door opened and entered Proshka, a boy of about thirteen, in such large boots that, stepping, he almost took his feet out of them. Why did you have such large boots, this can be found right right now: Plyushkin for the whole jaws, how much it was in the house, there were only boots that should have always been in the hallway. Everyone who was called to the Barshnaya chambers usually dancing through the whole yard barefoot, but, entering the canopy, put on boots and thus already appeared into the room. Leaving the room, he left his boots again in the hallway and went again on his own sole. If anyone looked from the window in the autumn and especially when small frosts begin in the morning, I would have seen that the whole jacket made such jumps that it was unlikely that it would be possible to stand out on the theaters the most brisk dancer.

- Look, Father, what a face! - said Plyushkin Chichikov, pointing a finger at his face. -After all, it’s stupid like a tree, but try to put something, steal in an instant! Well, why did you come, fool, tell me what? - Then he made a little silence, to which Proshka also answered in silence. - Put a samovar, hear, and take the key and give it to the Mavra to go to the pantry: there is a cracker from Kulich on the shelf, who brought Alexandra Stepanovna to serve him to tea! .. Wait, where are you? Fool! Ehhh, fool! The demon in your feet, or something, itching? .. You listen before: Currers from above, tea, sampled, so let it scresh him, and he will not throw a crumb, but will demolish it into the chicken coop. Yes, look, you don’t enter, brother, in the pantry, not that I, you know! Birch a broom, so that for taste! You now have a glorious appetite, so that it is still better! So try to go to the pantry, and in the meantime I will look from the window. They cannot be trusted in anything, ”he continued, turning to Chichikov, after the Proshka climbed along with his boots. After that, he began to look at Chichikov suspiciously. The features of such extraordinary generosity began to seem incredible to him, and he thought to himself: “After all, the devil knows, maybe he is just a bouncer, like all these motits; He will manage, he will manage to talk and get drunk, and then he will leave! " And therefore, out of precaution and together, wanting to search him a little, he said that it would be not good to make a merchant as soon as possible, because he was not sure in a person: today and God and God the news.

Chichikov expressed his readiness to make her at least this very minute and demanded only a list to all the peasants.

This reassured Plyushkin. It was noticeable that he came up with something to do something, and for sure, taking the keys, approached the closet and, taking off the door, rummaged for a long time between glasses and cups and finally said:

- After all, you won’t find it, but I had a glorious liquor, unless they drank! The people are such thieves! But isn't it? - Chichikov saw in his hands a decanter, who was all in dust, as in a funnel. “I also did the deceased,” Plyushkin continued, “the scammer of the keyboardist was completely abandoned and did not even clog, channel!” Kozyvyki and all rubbish were stuffed there, but I had a lot of burden, and now it’s clean; I pour you a glass.

But Chichikov tried to abandon such a liquor, saying that he had already drank and ate.

- We drank already and ate! - said Plyushkin. - Yes, of course, a good society of a person at least where you find out: he does not eat, but is full; And how is some thief, but no matter how much he feed ... After all, the captain will come: "Uncle, he says, give something to eat!" And I am to him the same uncle as he is my grandfather. There is nothing right at home, and so he is staggering! Yes, you need a registry of all these parasites? How, as I knew, I wrote all of them on a special piece of paper in order to cross them all at the first presentation of the revision.

Plyushkin put on glasses and began to rummage in the papers. Unleasing all sorts of ligaments, he touched his guest with such dust that he sneezed. Finally he pulled out a piece of paper, all scribbled. Peasant names strewn her closely, like midges. There were all sorts of: both Paramonov, and Pimenov, and Panteleimonov, and even some Gregory of Hygraziye, you’re not looking out; There were one hundred and twenty with a liner. Chichikov smiled at the sight of such large numbers. Hiding her in his pocket, he noticed Plyushkin that he would need to come to the city for the fortress.

- In town? But how? .. And how to leave the house? After all, I have a people or a thief or a fraudster: they are so loud that a caftan will have nothing to hang on.

-So do you have anyone?

- But who is a friend? All my friends freezed or met. Ah, father! How not to have, I have! He cried out. - After all, the chairman himself was familiar, even in the old years, he went to me, how not to know! They were one -browed, they climbed the fences together! How not a familiar? Such a friend! So is it not to write to him?

- And, of course, to him.

- Well, so familiar! There were friends at school.

And on this wooden face some kind of warm ray suddenly slipped, it was not a feeling, but a pale reflection of feelings, a phenomenon similar to the unexpected appearance on the surface of the water of a drowning, who made a joyful cry in the crowd that surrounded the shore. But in vain, the delighted brothers and sisters throw a rope from the shore and wait if the back or their hands weary with bones will flash again - the appearance was the last. Everything is deaf, and even worse and more deserted, after that, the subservient surface of the unrequited element becomes after that. So Plyushkin's face, following the feeling instantly slipping on him, became even more insensitive and even worse.

“A quarter of clean paper was lying on the table,” he said, “but I don’t know where I got into: people are so worthless!” - Then he began to look under the table and on the table, fumbled everywhere and finally shouted: - Mavra! And Moor!

A woman with a plate in her hands appeared at the call, on which a cracker was lying, already familiar to the reader. And between them there was such a conversation:

- Where are you, robber, paper?

-By golly, the master did not see, to oppose a small shred, which was deigned to cover the glass.

- But I see in my eyes that I was subtilibr.

“Why would I put it up?” After all, I have no use with her; I don't know literacy.

“You're lying, you demolished the sexton: he is smacked, so you demolished him.”

- Yes, the stubs, if he wants, will get his papers. He did not see your shred!

-Here's the wait for: at the Last Judgment, the devils will bake you for this with iron slingshots! Here you look how they will bake!

- But why will they bake, if I did not pick up and in my hands for fourth? Rather, another Babi weakness, and no one has already reproached me with theft.

-But the devil will be baked! They say: “And here you are, a scammer, for the fact that the master was deceiving!”, But they will bake you hot!

- And I will say: “Not at all! By golly, I didn’t take anything ... ”Yes, she lies on the table. Always reproaches in vain!

Plyushkin saw, for sure, a quarter and stopped for a minute, chewed his lips and said:

- Well, why did you disperse like that? Ekiy riverly! Tell her only one word, and she is in response a dozen! Come on, bring the light to seal the letter. Yes, stand, you will grab a greasy candle, the fat is a marshole: burning-and no, only a loss, and you bring me a light!

Mavra left, and Plyushkin, sitting in his chair and taking the pen in his hand, tossed the quarter for a long time, inventing: whether it was possible to separate the octopus from her, but finally became convinced that it was impossible; He stuck a feather into an inkwell with a moldy liquid and many flies at the bottom and began to write, putting down letters similar to musical notes, holding a skill with his hand, which was stubborn throughout the paper, scent a string on a line and not without regret, thinking about that that there will still be a lot of clean gaps.

And to such insignificance, pettyness, nasty things, a person could descend! Could change like that! And it looks like the truth? Everything is similar to the truth, everything can be with a person. The current fiery young man would have bounced with horror if they showed him his own portrait in old age. Take with you on the road, going out of the soft youthful years into a harsh fierce courage, take all human movements with you, do not leave them on the road, you will not rise later! The menacing, terrible old age is terrible ahead, and does not give anything back and back! The grave is more merciful than her, on the grave it will be written: “A person is buried here!”, But you will not read anything in the cold, insensitive features of inhuman old age.

“But you don’t know any of your friends,” said Plyushkin, folding the letter, “who would need runaway souls?”

- Do you have a fugitive? - Chichikov asked quickly, waking up.

-The fact of the matter is that there is. The son -in -law made straightening: he says that the trace was cold, but he is a military man: the master is spurled with spur, and if he had been patched by the courts ...

- And how many of them will be a number?

- Yes, dozens of up to seven will also be typed.

- No?

-And by golly, so! After all, I have something for a year, then they run. The people are painfully gluttonous, from idleness they got the habit of cracking, and I have nothing to do ... And I would have taken anything for them. So advise your friend: find only a dozen, so he has a glorious money. After all, the audit soul will flow in five hundred rubles.

“No, we won’t give a friend this to a friend,” Chichikov said to himself and then explained that there would be no such friend in any way that some costs in this case will cost more, because it is necessary to cut off the floors of his own caftan and leave even more; But what if he really is so squeezed, then, being moved by participation, he is ready to give ... But that this is such a trifle, which should not even be talked about.

- And how much would you give? - asked Plyushkin and himself revived: his hands trembled like mercury.

- I would give twenty -five cents for the soul.

- How do you buy, clean?

- Yes, now money.

-Only, Father, for the sake of my poverty, they would have already been given forty kopecks.

- The most respectable! - said Chichikov, - not only for forty kopecks, he would have paid five hundred rubles! I would love to pay, because I see - a venerable, kind old man suffers because of his own good nature.

-And by golly, so! By golly, really! - said Plyushkin, hanging his head down and shaking her crushing. - Everything is from good nature.

- Well, you see, I suddenly comprehended your character. So, why not give me five hundred rubles for my soul, but ... there is no consist; Five kopecks, if you please, is ready to add so that each soul, thus, cost thirty cents.

- Well, father, your will, fasten at least two pennies.

- Two pennies will fasten, please. How many of them do you have? You seem to have said seventy?

- No. In total, seventy -eight will be set.

- Seventy -eight, seventy -eight, thirty kopecks for the soul, it will be ... - Here is our hero one second, no more, thought and said suddenly: - It will be twenty -four rubles ninety -six kopecks! - He was strong in arithmetic. He immediately forced Plyushkin to write a receipt and gave him the money, which he accepted in both hands and carried them to the bureau with the same caution, as if he were carrying some liquid, fearing it every minute to melt it. He approached the bureau, he looked at them again and laid them out, also extremely carefully, in one of the boxes, where, rightly, they are destined to be buried until the father of Karp and Father Polycarp, two priests of his village, will not burden him, he himself, he himself, he himself, To the undeveloped joy of the son -in -law and the daughter, and perhaps the captain attributed to his relatives. Hiding the money, Plyushkin sat in his chair and already, it seemed, could no longer find matter, what to talk about.

- And what, are you going to go? He said, noticing a small movement that Chichikov made in order to get a scarf out of his pocket.

This question reminded him that in fact there was no more to heal.

- Yes, I have to go! He said, holding his hat.

- And the seagull?

“No, it’s better to someday at another time.”

- Well, I ordered the samovar. I admit to say, not a hunter to tea: the drink is expensive, and the price of sugar rose merciless. Proshka! No samovar! Cooking Mavra, you hear: let him put him in the same place or not, give him here, I will demolish him myself. Farewell, father, may God bless you, and you give the letter to the chairman. Yes! Let him read, he is my old acquaintance. How! Were him single -browsters!

This is a strange phenomenon, this cringed old man spent it from the yard, after which he ordered the gate to lock the same hour, then went around the pantries, in order to examine whether the watchman, who stood at all the corners, pounding with wooden shoulder blades in an empty barrel, a cast -iron board. After that, he looked into the kitchen, where, under the guise of trying, whether people eat well, ate at the scene of cache and, having chosen everyone to the last for theft and bad behavior, returned to his room. Left alone, he even thought about how to thank the guest for such an unprecedented generosity. “I will give him,” he thought to himself, “pocket watch: they are good, silver clock, and not that any tompak or bronze; a little closed, but he will transport himself; He is still a young man, so he needs a pocket watch to please his bride! Or not, ”he added after some thought,“ better I will leave them to him after my death, in the spiritual, so that he remembers me. ”

But our hero and without hours was in the most cheerful mood. Such an unexpected acquisition was a present gift. In fact, whatever you say, not only one dead souls, but also fugitive, and only two hundred and a man! Of course, while still approaching the village of Plyushkin, he had already anticipated that there would be somewhat to go, but he did not expect such a profitable one. All the way he was fun, whistled, played his lips, putting his fist to his mouth, as if playing a pipe, and finally pulled out some kind of song, so unusual that Selifan himself listened, listened and then, shaking his head slightly, he said : "You see how the master sings!" There were already thick twilight when they drove up to the city. The shadow with the light was completely mixed up, and it seemed that the objects were mixed too. The motley barrier took some vague color; The mustache at the soldier standing on the watch seemed on his forehead and much higher than the eyes, and the nose seemed to be not at all. Thunder and jumping let me notice that the brown rode rushed to the pavement. The lanterns have not yet been lit, in some places the windows of the houses were just begun, and scenes and conversations took place in the alleys and nooks, inseparable with this time in all cities, where there are many soldiers, cabs, workers and special kind of creatures, in the form of ladies in red paces And shoes without stockings, which, like bats, snoop along the intersections. Chichikov did not notice them and did not even notice many thin officials with canes, who, probably taking a walk outside the city, returned home. Occasionally, some kind of female exclamations seemed to his hearing: “You're lying, a drunkard! I never allowed him such rude! " -Or: “Do not be a fight, ignoramus, but go to the unit, there I will prove to you! ..” In a word, those words that suddenly will fade, like a var, some kind of twenty-year-old young man, when, returning from the theater, he carries In the head of Spanish street, night, a wonderful female image with a guitar and curls. What is not and what does not dream in his head? He drove in heaven and to Schiller-and suddenly the fateful words are heard above him, like thunder, and he sees that he again found himself on the ground, and even on Hamen Square, and even near the tavern, and again went in a battleship to flaunt Before him is life.

Finally, a breeze, having made a decent leap, sank, as if in a hole, into the gates of the hotel, and Chichikov was met by a Petrushko, who held the floor of his frock coat with one hand, because he did not like the floors to the other, and began to help him crawl out of the Brichka. The floor also ran out, with a candle in his hand and a napkin on his shoulder. Whether Parsley was delighted with the arrival of the master, it is not known, at least they moved with Selifan, and usually his harsh appearance this time seemed a little cleared.

“They made a walk for a long time,” said the sex, illuminating the stairs.

“Yes,” said Chichikov when he ascended the stairs. - Well, what are you?

“Thank God,” replied sex, bowing. -Yesterday, a lieutenant of a military man arrived, occupied the sixteenth number.

- Lieutenant?

- It is not known which, from Ryazan, bay horses.

- Okay, good, behave and go ahead! - said Chichikov and entered his room. Passing the front, he twisted his nose and said to Parsley: “You would, at least, at least the windows!”

“Yes, I unlocked them,” said Petrushka, and lied. However, Barin himself knew that he lied, but did not want to object. After the trip made, he felt strong fatigue. Demanding the easiest dinner, which was only in the pig, he undressed the same hour and, climbing under the blanket, fell asleep strongly, firmly, fell asleep in a wonderful way, just as those lucky people who know neither hemorrhoids, nor fleas, nor too strong mental abilities.

Chapter Seventh

The traveler is happy, who, after a long, boring road with her cold, slush, mud, low -flooded stationary caretakers, blinking bells, repair, choseners, coachmen, blacksmiths and all kinds of road scoundrels, finally sees a familiar roof with the lights rushing towards him, and familiar familiar are appearing before him. Rooms, a joyful cry of people who ran towards, the noise and running of children and soothing quiet speeches, interrupted by flaming knockers, powerful to exterminate everything sad from memory. Happy a family man who has such a corner, but woe to a bachelor!

The writer is happy, who is past the characters of boring, impressive, and his sad reality, approaches the characters, which is a high dignity of a person who, from the great whirlpool of spinning images, chose only few exceptions that had never changed his lifting, was not lowered with his lyre. His peaks to the poor, insignificant brothers, and, without touching the earth, all plunged into his far -tied from it and exalted images. The beautiful destiny is doubly envied: he is among them, as in his own family; Meanwhile, Glory is far and loud. He is OKULLY OF THE WORKING CUSTOMS Human Eyes; He miraculously flattered them, having a sad in life, showing them a wonderful person. Everything, a handicraft, rushes behind him and rushes after his solemn chariot. The great universal poet calls him, soaring high above all other geniuses of the world, as the eagle soars over other highly flying. In one name, young ardent hearts are already embraced by trepidation, response tears shine to him in all the eyes ... There is no equal to him in strength - he is God! But there is not such a destiny, and another fate of the writer who dared to call everything that is every minute before the eyes and that the indifferent eyes do not seek, the whole terrible, stunning Tina, who entangled our life, the whole depth of cold, fragmented, everyday characters that our teems in The earthly, sometimes bitter and boring road, and with the tight power of the inexorable incisive incisor daring to put them convexly and brightly on the popular eyes! He cannot collect folk applause, he will not ripen grateful tears and unanimous delight of souls excited by him; A sixteen -year -old girl with a swirling head and a heroic hobby will not meet him; He will not forget himself in the sweet charm of the butt sounds with him; Finally, he cannot be avoided from a modern court, a hypocritical and sensual modern court, which will call the coolens of the cherished creatures that he will give a despicable corner among the writers who insult humanity, give him the qualities of him depicted heroes, will move his heart from him, and his heart will move, And the soul and the divine flame of talent. For the modern court does not recognize that the glasses, looking around the suns and transmitting the movements of unnoticed insects are equally wonderful; For the modern court does not recognize that there is a lot of sincere depths, in order to illuminate a picture taken from a despicable life, and to build it to the pearl of creature; For the modern court does not recognize that the high enthusiastic laughter is worthy to become next to the high lyrical motion and that the whole gap between him and the croiling of the booth bundle! The modern court does not recognize this and will turn into a rebuke and reproach to an unrecognized writer; Without a section, without an answer, without a participation, as a houseless traveler, he will be left alone in the middle of the road. He is severely in the field, and he will bitterly feel his loneliness.

And for a long time it was determined by the miraculous power to go hand in hand with my strange heroes, to look for all a huge rushing life, to look through it through a prominent laughter and invisible tears unknown to him! And far away the time when the formidable blizzard of inspiration will rise from the thunderstorm in the holy horror and in the shirt of the chapter and feel the majestic thunder of other speeches in the embarrassed trembling ...

On the road! On the road! Away, a wrinkle and a strict dusk of a face that came across a person! At once and suddenly we will plunge into life with all its soundless chatter and bells and see what Chichikov is doing.

Chichikov woke up, pulled his arms and legs and felt that he had enough sleep. Having lie down for two minutes on his back, he snapped his hand and remembered his face shocked that he had now for almost four hundred souls. He immediately jumped out of bed, did not even look at his face, which he loved sincerely and in which, as it seems, he found his chin most attractive, because he very often boasted to one of his friends, especially if it happened during shaving. “Here, look,” he usually said, stroking his hand, “what my chin is: completely round!” But now he did not look at the chin or at his face, but right, as he was, put on saffyan boots with carved calculations of all kinds of flowers, which briskly the city of Torzhok is trading thanks to the negligent motives of the Russian nature, and, in Shotland, in one short The shirt, having forgotten his degree and decent middle summer, made two jumps around the room, slapping himself very cleverly with a heel of leg. Then at the same moment he got down to business: before the crook, rubbed his hands with the same pleasure as the incorruptible zemstvo court, suitable for the snack, who had gone to the investigation, and took out the paper from it. He wanted to finish everything as soon as possible, without putting it off in a long box. He himself decided to compose fortresses, write and rewrite, so as not to pay anything to decorate. He was completely known to him formal order: he put it briskly in capital letters: “One thousand eight hundred such and such a year,” then after those small ones: “The landowner is such and such,” and everything that follows. Everything was ready at two o’clock. When he later looked at these leaves, at the men, who, for sure, were once men, worked, plowed, drunk, aged, deceived a bar, and maybe they were just good men, then some strange, incomprehensible to him The feeling itself took possession of it. Each of the notes seemed to have some kind of special character, and through as if the very men received their own character. The men belonging to the box were almost with appendages and nicknames. Plyushkin’s note was distinguished by her brevity in the syllable: only the initial words of the names and patronics and then two points were often exhibited. The register of Sobakevich was struck by unusual fullness and thoroughness, not one of the qualities of a man was missed; One was said about one: “good carpenter”, it is attributed to the other: “The matter does not mean and does not take the hoppy.” It was also revealed in thief, who is the father, and who is the mother, and what both were behavior; Only some Fedotov was written: "Father is unknown who, but was born from the courtyard girl of the Capitoline, but a good temper and not a thief." All these details gave some special type of freshness: it seemed as if the men were alive yesterday. Looking for a long time at their names, he touched the spirit and, sighing, said: “My priests, how many you are crammed here! What did you, my heartfelt, divided in your eyelid? How did you interrupt? " And his eyes involuntarily stopped on one surname: it was the famous Peter Savelyev disobeying the Koryto, who once belonged to the landowner to the box. He again did not endure, so as not to say: “Eh, how long, he went out of the line! Were you a master or just a man, and with what death you took you? Is it in a tavern, or the middle of the road moved a sleepy clumsy wagon? Stepan traffic jam, carpenter, sobriety approximate. A! Here he is, Stepan Cormation, here is the hero that he would be suitable in the guard! Tea, all the provinces came with an ax behind his belt and boots on his shoulders, ate a penny of bread and two dried fish on a penny, and in the moshna, tea dragged the Khudikovs on the stupa every time, and maybe the state [42] sewn into hollow pants Or he plucked in a boot - where did you take you? Did you bother for a greater profit under the church dome, and perhaps dragged on the cross and, slipping, from there, from the crossbar, plopped over the ground, and only some uncle Micah, scratching his hand in the back of the head, lost: “Eh , Vanya, managed you! " - And he himself, tied with a rope, climbed into your place. Maxim Telyatnikov, shoemaker. Heh, shoemaker! “Drunk, like a shoemaker,” says the proverb. I know, I know you, darling; If you want, I’ll tell you the whole story: you studied with a German who fed you all together, beat you with a belt on the back for inaccurate and did not let you go to the street, and you were a miracle, not a shoemaker, and did not praise the German, speaking with his wife Or with a comrad. And how your teaching ended: “And now I will start my Domk,” you said, “but not like a German, that it stretches out of a penny, and suddenly we get rich.” And so, having given the master a decent quitron, you started a shop, having scored a bunch of orders, and went to work. I took out somewhere Veteashev’s nitrous skin and won, for sure, half on every boot, and after two weeks your boots shoveled for two weeks, and chose you in a mean way. And then your nap is desolate, and you went to drink and wallow through the streets, saying: “No, bad in the world! There is no life for a Russian person, all Germans interfere. ” This is what a man: Elizabeth Sparrow. Fu-you abyss: Baba! How was she clogged here? The scoundrel, Sobakevich, and here inflated! " Chichikov was right: it was, for sure, a woman. As she climbed there, it was unknown, but she was so skillfully prescribed that from afar it was possible to take her for a man, and even the name ended with the letter Ko, that is, not Elizabeth, but Elizabeth. However, he did not accept this in respect, and immediately crossed it. “Gregory, you’re not getting good! What kind of person were you? Lee lined up and, managed the three and the mature wagon, abdicated forever from the house, from his native den, and went to drag the merchants to the fair. On the road did you give your soul to God, or your friends left you for some thick and red-legged soldier, or you looked like a forest vagabond your belt mittens and a three squat, but strong skates, or, perhaps, lying on the grooves, thought I thought that he was wraped with no one from the other in a tavern, and then right into the hole, and remember what they called. Eh, Russian people! He does not like to die with his death! Are you my doves? - He continued, translating his eyes to a piece of paper, where Plyushkin's runaway souls were marked, - although you are still alive, and what's the point! The same as the dead, and somewhere your fast legs wear you now? Was it bad for you or simply, by your hunt, walking through the forests and wraps the carriageway? Are you sitting in prisons or pestering other gentlemen and pasting the earth? Eremey Karjakin, Nikita Dlokita, his son Anton Volokita - these, and, nicknamed, it can be seen that good runners. Popov, a courtyard, should be letters: a knife, I did not take tea, but stored a noble way. But now the captain-officer caught you the unspoor. You are cheerful at a full -time bet. “Whose are you?” Says the captain-officer, plunging some strong word to you during this faithful opportunity. “Such and such and such a landowner,” you answer Boyko. “Why are you here?” Says the captain-officer. “Allowed for quitters,” you answer without hesitation. “Where is your pashport?” - “The owner, the tradesman Pimenov”. - “Call Pimenova! Are you Pimenov? ” -“ I am Pimenov ”. - “He gave you his pashport?” - “No, he did not give me any Pashport.” “Well, what are you lying?” Says the captain-officer with an increase in some strong word. “So for sure,” you answer Boyko, “I did not give him, because I came home late, and gave it to the Antipu Prokhorov, ringing.” - “Call the bingard! Did he give you a pashport? ” -“ No, I didn’t receive a Pashport from him. ” - “Why are you lying again! -says the captain-officer, holding out the speech with some strong word. “Where is your pashport?”-“I had it,” you say crampedly, “yes, it may be clear that somehow the road has spared it.” “And the soldier's overcoat,” says the captain-officer, putting on you again in addition to some strong word, “why did you steal?” And the priest also has a chest with copper money? " -“ In any way, ”you say, without moving,“ have never found yourself in the thieves' business. ” -“Why did you find the overcoat?”-“I can’t know: right, someone else brought her.” - “Ah you beast, beast! -says the captain-officer, shaking his head and holding under his sides. - And put the pads on his feet and put him in jail. " - “Well up! I am happy, ”you answer. And so, having removed the snuff-box from your pocket, you treat the friendly some two disabled people stuffing the pads on you, and ask them, how long did they retire and in what war they were. And so you live in prison, for now your case is made in court. And the court writes: to take you from Tsarevokokshaysk to a prison of such and such a city, and that court writes again: to escort you to some Allogonsk, and you are moving from prison to prison and saying, examining a new abode: “No, here is the All -gon prison It will be cleaner: there, although in grandmothers, there is a place, and there is more society! "Abakum Fyrov! You, brother, what? Where, in what places are you staggering? Did you bring you to the Volga and you have loved a free life, sticking to the barlars? .. ”Then Chichikov stopped and thought slightly. What did he think about? Did he think about the fate of Abakum Fyrov or thought so, by himself, as every Russian is conceived, whatever years, the rank and state when the intent on the rampant of a wide life? And in fact, where is Fyrov now? He walks noisily and fun on the bread pier, fighting with the merchants. Flowers and ribbons on the hat, all the burglary vataga is having fun, saying goodbye to lovers and wives, tall, slender, in monists and ribbons; Rounders, songs, boils the whole area, and the porters, meanwhile, with screams, scolders and dugs, fading nine pounds on their backs, with a noise pour peas and wheat into deep ships, are kuli with oats and cereals, and it is visible in all its ways The areas of a heap of pyramids, like nuclei, bags, and the entire bread arsenal peeps greatly, until all overloads into deep Suryak ships [43] and the endless fleet will not rush along with spring ice. There you will work out, Burglaki! And together, as they used to walk and rained down, get out for work and sweat, dragging the strap under one endless song like Rus'.

“Eche, heh! twelve o'clock! - finally said Chichikov, looking at the watch. - Why am I so buried? Moreover, let him do the job, otherwise he first blocked the worship from either the other, and then thought. Eka I am really a fool! " Having said this, he changed his Scottish suit to the European, pulled his full stomach with a buckle tightly, spent himself with a cologne, picked up a warm crankcase and papers under the mouse and went to the civilian ward to make a merchant. He was in a hurry not because he was afraid to be late - he was not afraid to be late, because the chairman was familiar and could prolong and shorten his presence, like the ancient Zaes Homer, who lasted the days and saturated fast nights when it was necessary to stop the abuse or give them a means to finish, but he felt in himself a desire to bring things to an end more likely; Until then, everything seemed restless and awkward to him; Still, the thought came: that the souls are not entirely real and that in such cases such a burden always needs to be as soon as possible from the shoulders. Before he could go out into the street, thinking about all this and at the same time dragging on the shoulders of a bear, covered with brown cloth, as at the very turn into the lane, he also encountered the master in bears covered with brown cloth, and in a warm cartuze with ears. The master cried out, it was Manilov. They immediately enclosed each other in a hug and for about five minutes remained on the street in this position. Kisses on both sides were so strong that both of them had the front teeth almost had all day. Manilov, with joy, remained only his nose and lips on his face, his eyes completely disappeared. For a quarter of an hour, he held Chichikov’s hand with both hands and heated it terribly. At the revolutions of the thinnest and most pleasant, he told how he flew to hug Pavel Ivanovich; The speech was concluded by such a compliment, which is only decent for one girl, with whom they go to dance. Chichikov opened his mouth, not yet knowing how to thank, when suddenly Manilov took out a paper folded into a tube and tied with a pink ribbon from under a fur coat, and served very cleverly with two fingers.

- What's this?

- Faces.

- A! - He immediately turned it around, ran his eyes and marveled at the purity and beauty of handwriting. “It is gloriously written,” he said, “there is no need to rewrite.” Also a border around! Who so skillfully made a bunch?

“Well, don’t ask,” said Manilov.

- You?

- Wife.

- Oh my god! I, right, is ashamed to me that I inflicted so many difficulties.

- There is no difficulty for Pavel Ivanovich.

Chichikov bowed with gratitude. Having learned that he was going to the ward for making a merchant, Manilov outlined his readiness to accompany him. Friends took up arm and went together. With any small elevation, or a hill, or a step, Manilov supported Chichikov and almost lifted it with his hand, adding a pleasant smile that he would not allow Pavel Ivanovich to kill his legs. Chichikov consciously knew, not knowing how to thank, for he felt that he was somewhat heavy. In mutual services, they finally reached the area where the places were present: a large three -story stone house, all white, like chalk, probably for depicting the purity of the souls of the posts placed in it; Other buildings in the square did not meet vastness with a stone house. These were: a guard booth, which stood a soldier with a gun, two or three cabs and, finally, long fences with well-known fence inscriptions and drawings, scratched with coal and chalk; There was nothing more on this secluded, or, as we are expressed, a beautiful area. The incorruptible heads of the priests of Themis protruded from the windows of the second and third floor and at that moment hid again: probably, at that time the boss entered the room. Friends did not rise, but ran up the stairs, because Chichikov, trying to avoid support under the arms of Manilov, accelerated his step, and Manilov, too,, for his part, flew forward, trying not to let Chichikov get tired, and therefore both were very out of breath when they were very much when they were very much when they were very very when We joined the dark corridor. Neither in the corridors nor in the rooms their eyes were struck by purity. Then they did not care about her, and what was dirty was dirty, without accepting attractive appearance. Themis is simple, which is, in Neggle and the dressing gown, she received guests. Office rooms that our heroes were held should be described, but the author nourishes strong timidity to all present places. If it happened to him to go through them even in brilliant and ennobled form, with varnished floors and tables, he tried to run as soon as possible, humbly lowering and pulling his eyes into the ground, and therefore does not know how everything was prosperous and flourishing. Our heroes saw a lot of paper, and black and white, tilted heads, wide backs, tailcoat, granuts of the provincial cut and even just some light gray jacket, which separated very abruptly, which, with a piercing head to the side and putting it on almost the paper itself, I wrote out a briskly and imprinted some protocol about the deletion of the Earth or the inventory of the estate, captured by some peaceful landowner, who has long survived the century under trial, who had borrowed both children and grandchildren under his cover, and the short expressions pronounced by a hoarse voice were heard in snatches: ““ ““ ““ “ Batract, Fedosey Fedoseevich, businessman for No. 368! ” -"You always drag a cork from the official inkwell somewhere!" Sometimes the voice is more magnificent, without a doubt of one of the bosses, I was heard imperiously: “On, rewrite! It’s not that your boots will be removed and you’ll sit for my six days not Evshi. ” The noise from the feathers was large and looked like a few carts with brushwood passed, littered with dry leaves littered by a quarter of arshin.

Chichikov and Manilov approached the first table, where two officials were sitting, and asked:

- Let me find out where are things to do with the fortresses?

- What do you need? - both officials said, turning around.

- And I need to submit a request.

- What did you buy this?

- I would like to know before where the fortress was, here or in another place?

- Yes, tell me before, what we bought and at what price, so we will tell you then where, and you can’t know so.

Chichikov immediately saw that the officials were simply curious, like all young officials, and wanted to give more weight and significance to themselves and their studies.

“Listen, dear ones,” he said, “I know very well that all the things are in the fortresses, whatever the price, are in one place, and therefore I ask you to show us the table, and if you do not know that you have It is done, so we will ask others.

The officials did not answer anything, one of them only poked his finger at the corner of the room, where some old man was sitting at the table, moving some papers. Chichikov and Manilov passed between the tables directly to him. The old man was engaged very carefully.

“Let me find out,” Chichikov said with a bow, “are things about the fortresses?”

The old man looked up and said with the arrangement:

- There are no things in the fortresses.

- And where?

- This is in the fortress expedition.

- And where is the serf expedition?

- This is Ivan Antonovich.

- And where is Ivan Antonovich?

The old man poked his finger at the other corner of the room. Chichikov and Manilov went to Ivan Antonovich. Ivan Antonovich had already launched one eye back and looked around them squinted, but at that very moment he plunged even more attentive into the Scripture.

“Let me find out,” Chichikov said with a bow, “is the fortress table here?”

Ivan Antonovich seemed to have not heard and went deep into the paper, without answering anything. It was suddenly seen that this was already a man of prudent years, not like a young talker and helicopter. Ivan Antonovich seemed to have already had far in forty years; The hair on it was black, thick; The whole middle of the face protruded forward and went into the nose - in a word, this was the person that is called in the dormitory of the jug.

- Let me find out, here is a serf expedition? - said Chichikov.

“Here,” said Ivan Antonovich, turned his jug of it and followed to write again.

- And I have the case: I bought from different owners of the local district peasants to the conclusion: there is a merchant, it remains to be done.

- And the sellers are obvious?

- Some here, but from other power of attorney.

- Have you brought the request?

- brought a request. I would like to ... I need to hurry up ... Is it possible, for example, to finish the matter today?

- Yes today! Today it is impossible, ”said Ivan Antonovich. - We need to make more inquiries, if there are still prohibitions.

- However, that before it is to accelerate the case, so Idan Grigoryevich, the chairman, is a great friend to me ...

- Why, Ivan Grigoryevich is not one; There are others, ”said Ivan Antonovich severely.

Chichikov understood the hardener, which was wrapped in Ivan Antonovich, and said:

- Others will not be offended either, I myself served, I know the matter ...

“Go to Ivan Grigoryevich,” Ivan Antonovich said a little more half -most in his voice, “let him give an order to whom he should, but we will not stand behind us.”

Chichikov, taking a piece of paper from his pocket, put it in front of Ivan Antonovich, which he completely did not notice and immediately covered it with her book. Chichikov wanted to show her to him, but Ivan Antonovich made his head with the movement of his head that he did not need to show.

- So he will lead you into presence! - said Ivan Antonovich, nodding his head, and one of the priests who were immediately located, with such a zeal of the victim Femide that both sleeves burst on the elbows and a lining for a long time, for which he received a colleague registrar at one time, served our friends, served as our friends, served. As Virgil once served Dantu, [44] and led them into the presence room, where there were only wide seats and in them in front of the table, behind the mirror [45] and two thick books, sat the same as the sun as the Sun. In this place, the new Virgil felt such a reverence that he did not dare to bring his leg there and turned it back, showing his back, wiped like a mowing with a chicken pen ending somewhere. Entering the hall of presence, they saw that the chairman was not alone, Sobakevich was sitting beside him, completely obscured by the mirror. The arrival of the guests made exclamation, government chairs were pushed back with noise. Sobakevich also got up from the chair and became visible from all sides with his long sleeves. The chairman took Chichikov in an arms, and the presence of the presence was announced by kisses; asked each other about health; It turned out that both were pampering the lower back, which was immediately attributed to a sedentary life. The chairman seemed to be already notified by Sobakevich of the purchase, because he began to congratulate that at first it was a little mixed by our hero, especially when he saw that Sobakevich and Manilov, both sellers, with whom the case was settled, now stood his face to a friend to a friend. friend. However, he thanked the chairman and, turning immediately to Sobakevich, asked:

- And your health?

“Thank God I won’t complain,” said Sobakevich.

And for sure, there was nothing to complain about: rather, iron could catch a cold and cough than this laid out a marvelous landowner.

“Yes, you were always famous for health,” said the chairman, “and your deceased father was also a strong man.”

“Yes, one was hazhal to the bear,” answered Sobakevich.

“It seems to me, however,” said the chairman, “you would also have a bear if you wanted to come out against him.”

“No, I won’t fall,” answered Sobakevich, “the deceased was stronger than me,“ and, sighing, continued: “No, now the wrong people;” Here's though my life, what kind of life? So somehow for yourself ...

- Why is your life not red? - said the chairman.

“Not good, not good,” said Sobakevich, shaking his head. - You judge, Ivan Grigoryevich: I live the fifth ten, has never been sick; If only his throat fell ill, Vered or Kiree jumped out ... No, not good! Someday you have to pay for it. - Then Sobakevich plunged into melancholy.

“Ec,” thought Chichikov and the chairman at one time, “what I thought to blame!”

“I have a letter to you,” said Chichikov, taking a letter from Plyushkin from his pocket.

- From whom? - said the chairman and, printing, exclaimed: - Ah! From Plyushkin. He still lives in the world. Here is fate, because what the smartest, richest man was! and now…

“Dog,” said Sobakevich, “a fraudster, he crumbled all people with hunger.”

“Please, if you please,” said the chairman, having read the letter, “I am ready to be attorney.” When do you want to make a merchant, now or after?

“Now,” said Chichikov, “I will even ask you, if possible, today, because tomorrow I would like to leave the city;” I brought both the fortresses and the request.

- All this is good, only, as you want, we will not release you so early. The fortresses will be committed today, but you will still live with us. Now I will give the order now, ”he said and opened the door to the office room, all filled with officials who were likened to hardworking bees scattered on the honeycombs, if only the honeycombs can be likened to office affairs: - Ivan Antonovich is here?

“Here,” said a voice from the outside.

- Call him here!

Already well -known to readers Ivan Antonovich Kuvshinny Rylo appeared in the presence hall and bowed respectfully.

- Take it, Ivan Antonovich, all these fortresses are ...

“Don’t forget it, Ivan Grigoryevich,” said Sobakevich, “will need witnesses, although two on each side.” Now send to the prosecutor, he is a idle person and, rightly, sits at home, he does everything for him a hairy gold, the first hapug in the world. The inspector of the medical council, he is also a idle person and, rightly, at home, if he didn’t go somewhere to play cards, and there is a lot of who are closer-Trukhachevsky, Begushkin, they will all vigorize the land!

- Exactly! - said the chairman and for the same hour tuned after them all the office.

“I will also ask you,” said Chichikov, “send for the attorney of one landowner, with whom I also made a deal, the son of Protopop Father Kiril; He serves with you.

“Well, I’ll send it behind him!” - said the chairman. - Everything will be done, but you don’t give anything to anyone, I ask you about it. My friends should not pay. -Having said this, he immediately gave some order to Ivan Antonovich, as he saw not like. The fortresses seemed to have a good action on the chairman, especially when he saw that all the purchases were almost one hundred thousand rubles. For several minutes he looked into Chichikov's eyes with a expressing great pleasure and finally said:

- So how! It’s that way, Pavel Ivanovich! So you purchased.

“I got it,” answered Chichikov.

- Good deed, right, good deed!

- Yes, I see myself that I could not do a more good thing. Be that as it may, the man’s goal is still not determined, if he did not finally become a firm stack on a strong base, and not on any voluntary chimera of youth. - Here he very incredible for liberalism, and rightly, all young people. But it is remarkable that in his words there was all some kind of unsteady, as if he immediately said to himself: “Eh, brother, you are lying, and even strong!” He did not even look at Sobakevich and Manilov out of fear to meet something on their faces. But in vain he was afraid: Sobakevich's face did not move, and Manilov, charmed with a phrase, only shook with pleasure with approvingly head, plunging into the position in which the music lover was located, when the singer was pushing the very hidden and squeaked such a thin note as a bird’s throat and a bird's throat .

“Yes, what can you tell Ivan Grigoryevich,” Sobakevich said, “what exactly did you get;” And you, Ivan Grigoryevich, that you will not ask what acquisition they made? After all, what a people! Just gold. After all, I also sold them the brown of Mikheev.

- No, as if Mikheev was sold? - said the chairman. - I know Mikheev’s brown line: a glorious master; He remade me tremors. Just let me, how ... After all, you told me that he died ...

- Who, Mikheev died? - said Sobakevich, not at all mixed. - It was his brother who died, and he was obsolete and became healthier than the former. The other day, I set up such a brichka that you couldn’t do it in Moscow. He really is only one sovereign and work.

“Yes, Mikheev is a glorious master,” said the chairman, “and I even wonder how you could part with him.”

- Yes, as one Mikheev! And Stepan's cork, carpenter, Milushkin, brick, Maxim Lalcons, shoemaker, because everyone went, sold everyone! - And when the chairman asked why they went, being the people necessary for the house and the artisans, Sobakevich answered, waving his hand: - Ah! So simple, I found nonsense: Give, I say, I will sell, and I sold it off! - He hung his head as if he had repented himself in this matter, and added: - Here is a gray -haired man, but still did not gain his mind.

“But let me, Pavel Ivanovich,” said the chairman, “how do you buy peasants without land?” Is it a conclusion?

- To the conclusion.

- Well, the conclusion is another matter. And in what places?

- To the places ... to the Kherson province.

- Oh, there are excellent lands! - said the chairman and responded with great praise about the growth of the herbs there. - And the lands in sufficient quantities?

- in sufficient; As much as you need for purchased peasants.

- A river or a pond?

- River. However, there is a pond. -Having said this, Chichikov looked inadvertently at Sobakevich, and although Sobakevich was still motionless, it seemed to him that it was written on his face: “Oh, you are lying! It is unlikely that there is a river, and a pond, and the whole earth! ”

While the conversations continued, witnesses began to appear little by little: a familiar prosecutor-Morgun, inspector of the medical council, Trukhachevsky, Begushkin and others, according to Sobakevich, for nothing, spinning the land. Many of them were completely unfamiliar to Chichikov: the lacked and superfluous were scored right there, from tent officials. They also brought not only the son of Protopop Father Kiril, but even Protopop himself. Each of the witnesses placed himself with all his virtues and ranks, some with a working font, some shoals, who are just almost upside down, placing such letters, which was not even seen in the Russian alphabet. The famous Ivan Antonovich managed very agilely: the fortresses were recorded, marked, entered in the book and where it should, with the adoption of semi -percent and for the print in Vedomosti, and Chichikov had to pay a little. Even the chairman gave an order from duty money to take only half from him, and the other, it is not known how, was assigned to some other petitioner.

“So,” said the chairman, when it was all over, “now it remains only to disappear the purchase.”

“I'm ready,” said Chichikov. - It only depends on the appointment of time. It would be a sin on my part if, for a kind of pleasant society, not to disperse another, the third bottle of sparkle.

“No, you have not accepted the case: we put it for ourselves,” said the chairman, “this is our duty, our duty.” You are a guest with us: we must treat us. Do you know what, gentlemen! For now, what, but we’ll do how to do it: go all, since there is, to the police officer; He has a miracle worker with us: he only has to blink, passing by a fish row or cellar, so we, you know, we will bite it! Yes, with this opportunity and to the whistle.

No one could refuse such a proposal. Witnesses, with one name of the fish row, felt an appetite; The same hour took the same hour for the cartules and hats, and the presence ended. When they passed the office, Ivan Antonovich Kuvshinny Rylo, politely bowing, said slowly Chichikov:

- The peasants were bought one hundred thousand, and only one white was given for the labors. [46]

“Why, what are the peasants,” Chichikov answered him also in a whisper.

Ivan Antonovich realized that the visitor was the nature of the firm and would not give it anymore.

- How much did you buy a soul from Plyushkin? - whispered to his other ear of Sobakevich.

- And why did the sparrow attribute? - Chichikov told him in response.

- What sparrow? - said Sobakevich.

- Yes, a woman, Elizabeth of a sparrow, also put the letter Kommersant at the end.

“No, I did not attribute any sparrow,” said Sobakevich and went to other guests.

The guests finally got to the householder’s house with a crowd. The police officer, for sure, was a miracle worker: as soon as he heard, what was the matter, at that moment he clicked the quarterly, brisk small in varnished boots, and, it seems, only two words whispered in his ear and only added: “You understand!” - And there, in another room, in the continuation of the time that the guests were cut into the whist, appeared on the Beluga, sturgeon, salmon, the slurry caviar, fresh -funal caviar, herring, stittering, smoked tongues and balls, it was all From the fishing side. Then there were additions from the master's side, the product of the kitchen: a cake with a strong -winged, which included cartilage and cheeks of a nine -pound sturgeon, another pie with cooles, buckles, oils, [47] ravines. [48]

The police officer was in some way the father and philanthropist in the city. He was among the citizens completely like in his own family, and he visited the shops and in the guest courtyard, as in his own pantry. In general, he sat, as they say, in his place and his position suffered perfectly. It was difficult to even decide whether it was created for a place or a place for him. The matter was so conducted smartly that he received twice as many income against all his predecessors, but meanwhile he earned the love of the whole city. The first merchants loved him very much, precisely because he was not proud; And for sure, he baptized children at them, cummed with them, and even at least he was fighting them strongly, but somehow extremely deftly: it will be trampled on the shoulder, and it will go into tea, he promises to come and come to play checkers, ask about everything : like deeds, what and how. If he finds out that the cub somehow struck, and the medicine is entrusted,-in a word, well done! He will go on yeasts, give order, and meanwhile, the word will say a different way: “What, Mikheich! We would need to finish the slide with you and I would finish it. ”[49] “Yes, Alexey Ivanovich,” he answered, taking off his hat, “it would be necessary.” - “Well, brother, Ilya Paramonych, come to me to look at the trotter: it will go to overtaking with yours, and put my own in the runaways; Let's try. " The merchant, who was obsessed with the trotter, smiled at this with a particular, as they say, hunting and, stroking the beard, said: “Let's try, Alexey Ivanovich!” Even all the sites [50] usually at this time, having removed the caps, looked at each other with pleasure and seemed to want to say: “Alexey Ivanovich is a good person!” In a word, he managed to acquire the perfect nationality, and the opinion of the merchants was such that Alexei Ivanovich "although it would take it, but he would not give you out in any way."

Having noticed that the snack was ready, the police officer invited the guests to graduate from Vist after breakfast, and everyone went to the room from where the smell that had rushed for a long time began to in a pleasant manner of tickling the nostrils of the guests and where the dog was already looking at the door for a long time, outlining the sturgeon, lying aside on a large dish. Guests, having drunk on a glass of vodka of dark olive color, which happens only on Siberian transparent stones, of which they cut in Rus', they began from all sides with forks to the table and began to detect, as they say, each of their character and inclinations, lying on caviar Someone on salmon, some for cheese. Sobakevich, leaving all these little things without any attention, settled down to the sturgeon, and, while they drank, talked and ate, he arrived at a quarter of an hour with a little, so when the police officer remembered him and, saying: “And what is it to you , gentlemen, will this work of nature seem? " - I approached him with a fork along with others, then I saw that only one tail remained from the work of nature; And Sobakevich hissed as if not he, and, approaching a plate that was away, poked a fork in some dried little fish. Having finished the sturgeon, Sobakevich sat in his chair and no longer ate, did not drink, but only squinted and clapped his eyes. The police officer, it seems, did not like to regret wine; There were no toasts. The first toast was drunk, as readers, perhaps they themselves would guess, for the health of the new Kherson landowner, then for the prosperity of the peasants and their happy resettlement, then for the health of his future wife, beauty, which broke a pleasant smile from the lips of our hero. They started him from all sides and began to beg to convincingly stay at least two weeks in the city:

- No, Pavel Ivanovich! As you want, this comes out only to emasculate: on the threshold, and back! No, you will spend time with us! Here we are marrying you: isn't it, Ivan Grigoryevich, marry him?

- Begling, marry! - the chairman picked up. - No matter how you rest your arms and legs, we marry you! No, father, got here, do not complain. We do not like to joke.

- Well? Why rest your arms and legs, ”Chichikov said, grinning,“ marriage, “marriage is not such a thing that there would be a bride.”

- There will be a bride, how not to be, everything will be, everything you want! ..

- And if there will be ...

- Bravo, remains! - screamed everyone. - Vivat, cheers, Pavel Ivanovich! hooray! - And everyone approached him to clink with glasses in their hands.

Chichikov jumped out with everyone. "No, no, yet!" - said those that were coarser, and again jumped; Then they climbed for the third time clinking, jumping out for the third time. In a short time, everyone became fun unusually. The chairman, who was a premium, when he was amused, hugged Chichikov several times, saying in the heart from the heart: “You are my soul! My mother! " “And even, clicking his fingers, he went to dance around him, singing a well -known song:“ Oh, you are like that and a sort of Kamarin man. ” After champagne, they dispersed the Hungarian, which gave even more spirit and amused society. They resolutely forgot about Vista; They argued, shouted, talked about everything: about politics, about the military, even the case, set out free thoughts, for which at another time they themselves would have selected their children. We immediately resolved a lot of most difficult issues. Chichikov never felt in such a cheerful location, imagined himself to be a real Kherson landowner, talked about various improvements: about the three -sex economy, about the happiness and bliss of two souls, and began to read Sobakevich a message in the verse of Werther to Charlotte, [51] for which he was that one He clapped only his eyes, sitting in the chairs, for after sturgeon he felt a big urge to bed. Chichikov realized himself and he had already begun to get too untie, he asked for the crew and took advantage of the prosecutors. The prosecutor's coachman, as it turned out on the road, was a small experienced, because he ruled with one hand, and putting it back with the other, held it with the master. Thus, already at the prosecutor’s yeast he drove to his hotel, where every nonsense turned in his tongue for a long time: a blond bride with a blush and a dimple on his right cheek, Kherson villages, and capital. Selifan was even given some economic orders: to collect all the newly resettled men in order to make everyone personally unlocking. Selifan silently listened for a very long time and then left the room, saying Parsley: "Go to undress the master!" Parsley began to take off his boots from him and almost pulled with them to the floor and the master himself. But finally, the boots were removed; Barin undressed properly and, turning a few time on a bed that hidden mercilessly, fell asleep resolutely by the Kherson landowner. Meanwhile, Petrushka took the pantalones on the corridor and a striking bar with a spark, which, spreading onto a wooden hanger, began to beat with a whip and brush, letting the dust throughout the corridor. Preparing to take them off, he looked down from the gallery and saw a selifan returning from the stable. They met their eyes and understood each other: Barin de fell to sleep, you can look somewhere. The same hour, having taken the tailcoat and the Pantalones to the room, Parsley went down, and both went together, not saying anything about the purpose of the trip and the Balagurya completely about an outsider. They made a walk near: it was only to the other side of the street, to the house, who was an appropriate hotel, and entered a low glass,, smutted door, which brought almost all kinds of wooden tables: and not shave off and not shaved a beard, and not shave off the beards, And in nago sheepskin coats and just in the shirt, and some in the frieza overcoat. [52]

What did parsley with Seliphan do there, God knows them, but they left there an hour later, holding hands, maintaining perfect silence, providing each other's attention and warning mutually from all kinds of corners. The hand in the hand, not letting out each other, they climbed the stairs for a quarter of an hour, finally defeated her and rose. Parsley stopped a minute before his low bed, inventing how to lie more decent, and lay down completely across, so that his legs rested on the floor. Selifan himself lay on the same bed, placing his head in the belly on his belly and forgetting that he should have been sleeping not here at all, but, perhaps, in human, if not in the stable near horses. Both fell asleep at the same moment, raising the snoring of unheard of density, to which the master from another room answered with a thin nasal whistle. Soon, after them, everything calmed down, and the hotel appeared in an unforgettable dream; Only in one window there was still a light where some lieutenant who came from Ryazan lived, a large, apparently, hunter to his boots, because he already ordered four pairs and constantly tried on the fifth. He approached the bed several times in order to throw them off and lie down, but he couldn’t: the boots, for sure, were well sewn, and for a long time he raised his leg and looked at a brisk -headed heel.

Chapter eight

Chichikov’s purchases have become a subject of conversation. In the city there were no sense, opinions, discussions about whether it is profitable to buy for the conclusion of the peasants. From the debate, many responded to the perfect knowledge of the subject. “Of course,” others said, “this is so, there is no dispute against this: the lands in the southern provinces are certainly good and fertile; But what will the peasants of Chichikov be without water? There is no river. ” “It would be nothing yet that there is nothing, it would be nothing, Stepan Dmitrievich, but the resettlement is an unreliable thing. The thing is well -known that a man: on the New Earth, but to do even a tuture, but he has nothing, neither huts nor yard - he will run away, as twice two, it will run the ski so much that you can’t find a trace. ” - “No, Alexey Ivanovich, let me, let me, I do not agree that you say that a man Chichikov will run away. The Russian person is capable of everything and gets used to any climate. He went to Kamchatka at least, give me only warm mittens, he pats his hands, an ax in his hands, and went to chop a new hut. ” - “But, Ivan Grigoryevich, you lost sight of an important thing: you still did not ask what a man was with Chichikov. I forgot that the landowner will not sell a good person; I am ready to put my head, if a man Chichikov is not a thief or a drunkard to the last extent, idle -shaped and violent behavior. ” -“So, I agree to this, it is true that no one will sell good people, and the men Chichikov Drunk, but we must take into account that it is morality, it is morality: they are now villains , and, having moved to the new land, they can suddenly become excellent subjects. There were already many such examples: just in the world, and in history too. ” “Never, never,” said the manager of state factories, “believe me, it can never be.” For the peasants of Chichikov will now have two strong enemies. The first enemy is the proximity of the provinces of Little Russian, where, as you know, free sale of wine. I assure you: in two weeks they will get out and will be insoles. Another enemy is already the very habit of vagrant life, which must be acquired by peasants during relocation. Is it necessary that they were forever before Chichikov’s eyes and that he would hold them in the hedgehog mittens, chased them for all nonsense, and not that relying on another, but so that he personally, where he should, would give a dentist and slap ". “Why should Chichikov mess with himself and give slap, he can find the ruler.” - "Yes, you will find the ruler: all scammers!" “Fraudsters because gentlemen are not doing business.” “This is true,” many picked up. “Know the gentleman himself, although at any sense in the farm and know how to distinguish people-he will always have a good ruler.” But the manager said that less than five thousand can not be found a good manager. But the chairman said that you can find in three thousand. But the manager said: “Where do you find him? Is it in your nose? " But the chairman said: “No, not in the nose, but in the local county, namely: Pyotr Petrovich Samoilov: Here is the ruler, which is needed for the Chichikov men!” Many were very part of Chichikov’s position, and the difficulty of resettleing such a huge number of peasants became extremely frightened by them; They began to fear very much so that even a riot did not happen between such a restless people, what are the peasants of Chichikov. To this, the police officer noticed that the riot has nothing to fear that his power exists exists the power of the captain-officer, that the captain-officer, even do not go, and went only to his place of his own casing, then this one casing will drive the peasants to their place to their place residence. Many suggested their opinions about how to eradicate the violent spirit, overwhelming the peasants of Chichikov. There were all kinds of opinions: there were those who were already overly responding to the military with cruelty and strictness, almost unnecessary; There were, however, those who breathed meekness. The postmaster noted that Chichikov has a sacred duty, that he could be among his peasants some kind of father, in his expression, to introduce even a beneficial education, and at the same time responded with a great praise about the Lancaster school [53] mutual education.

Thus, they reasoned and spoke in the city, and many, encouraged by participation, even some of these Soviets, even offered Chichikov, even offered a convoy for the safe preference of the peasants to the place of residence. For the advice of Chichikov, he thanked Chichikov, saying that on occasion he would not pretend to be used, but he decisively refused the convoy, saying that he was completely not needed, that the peasants he bought excellently, they themselves feel the voluntary location for relocation and that the rebellion in no case There can be no between them.

All these rumors and reasoning produced, however, the most favorable consequences that Chichikov could expect. It was rumors that he was no more, no less than a millionaire. The inhabitants of the city, already, as we already saw in the first chapter, sincerely loved Chichikov, and now, after such rumors, they loved even more sincere. However, if you tell the truth, they were all good people, they lived among themselves in Lada, turned completely on the wiring, and their conversations wore a stamp of some special innocence and shortness: “My dear friend Ilya Ilyich”, “Listen, brother, antipol Zakharyevich! ”,“ You are lied, mommy, Ivan Grigoryevich. ” To the postmaster, whose name was Ivan Andreevich, was always added: "Shprahen Zechta, Ivan Andreich?" - In a word, everything was very family. Many were not without education: the Chairman of the Chamber knew Zhukovsky’s “Lyudmila” by heart, who was still not difficult to news, and masterfully read many places, especially: “Bor fell asleep, the valley is sleeping”, and the word “Chu!” So that it really was seen as if the valley was sleeping; For greater similarities, even at this time he closed his eyes. The postmaster went into philosophy more and read very diligently, even at night, the Yungovs of the “night” and “the key to the sacraments of nature” by Ekartshausen, [54] of which he made very long extracts, but what kind they were, this was not known; However, he was an wit, a flowery in words and loved, as he expressed himself, to condensate speech. And he fell asleep in many different particles, somehow: “You are my judo, a kind of some, you know, you know, you can imagine, just to speak, in some way,” and other ones that he poured with bags; He also fell asleep with a rather successfully luggling, squinting one eye, which all gave a very caustic expression to many of his satirical hints. Others were also more or less enlightened: who read Karamzin, who “Moscow Vedomosti”, who did not even read anything at all. Who was what Tyuryuk is called, that is, a person who had to be raised by a kick on something; Who was just a baibak, lying, as they say, for the whole century on his side, which was even in vain to raise: he would not get up in any case. As for the testimony, it is already known, all of them were reliable people, there was no one between them. Everyone was of this kind that wives in the delicate conversations taking place in solitude gave the names: cubes, a thickness, a puzantik, chernushki, kiki, zhuyu and so on. But in general, they were good people, full of hospitality, and the person who tasted the bread-salt with them or sat behind the whist was already becoming something close, especially Chichikov with his charming qualities and techniques, who really knew a great secret. They love him so much that he did not see the means of how to break out of the city; He only heard: "Well, a week, live another week with us, Pavel Ivanovich!" - In a word, he was wearing, as they say, in his hands. But the impression was incomparably remarkable (a perfect amazement!), Which made Chichikov on the ladies. In order to explain this anymore, a lot should be said about the ladies themselves, about their society, to describe, as they say, with live colors their spiritual qualities; But for the author it is very difficult. On the one hand, he stops his unlimited reverence for the spouses of dignitaries, and on the other hand ... on the other hand, it is simply difficult. The ladies of the city of N. were ... no, I can’t in any way: it is felt for sure timid. In the ladies of the city, N. was most wonderful that ... even strange, the feather does not rise at all, as if some kind of lead is sitting in it. So be it: about their characters, apparently, it is necessary to say to one who has the older paints and more of them on the palette, and we will have two words about the appearance and that it is more stubborn. The ladies of the city of N. were what they call presentable, and in this regard they could be safely set as an example to everyone else. As before behaving, observing the tone, maintaining etiquette, many decency of the thinnest, and especially observing the fashion in the very last little things, then in this they even ahead of the ladies of St. Petersburg and Moscow. They dressed with great taste, traveled around the city in strollers, as the last fashion prescribed, a footman swayed from behind, and the livery in golden positions. A business card, whether it is written at least on a trefoil dual or a dormitory bezed, but the thing was very sacred. Because of her, two ladies, big friends and even relatives, quarreled completely, precisely for the fact that one of them somehow draped countervizitis. And no matter how hard the husbands and relatives tried to reconcile them, but no, it turned out that everything can be done in the world, one could not: to reconcile two ladies who quarreled for the visiting a visit. So both ladies remained in mutual disruption, in the expression of urban light. As for the occupation of the first places, there were also a lot of very strong scenes, who inspired husbands sometimes completely knightly, generous concepts of intercession. Duel, of course, did not happen between them, because everyone was civilian officials, but one to another tried to play the other, where it was possible, which, as you know, is sometimes heavier than any duel. In the morals, the ladies of the city of N. were strict, performed by noble indignation against all vicious and all sorts of temptations, and executed all sorts of weaknesses without any mercy. If there was some that the other, then it happened in secret, so that there was not any kind that happened that happened; All dignity was preserved, and the husband itself was so prepared that if I saw another, three or heard about it, it answered briefly and prudently with a proverb: "Who cares that Kuma and Kuma sat." I must also say that the ladies of the city of N. differed, like many ladies of St. Petersburg, unusual caution and decency in words and expressions. They never said: “I was wandered away”, “I sweated”, “I spat”, and they said: “I facilitated my nose”, “I cost through a scarf.” In no case could one say: "This glass or this plate stinks." And even nothing could be said to give a hint of this, but they said instead: “This glass behaves badly” or something like that. In order to even more ennoble the Russian language, half of almost words was thrown out of a conversation at all and therefore very often needed to resort to the French language, but there, in French, another thing: there were such words that were much wider than the mentioned. So, this is what can be said about the ladies of the city, speaking more folly. But if you look deeper, then, of course, many other things will open; But it is very dangerous to look deeper into lady's hearts. So, limited to the surface, we will continue. Until now, all the ladies somehow spoke little about Chichikov, giving, however, to him complete justice in the pleasantness of secular appeal; But since rumors flashed about its millionality, other qualities have been found. However, the ladies were not at all interesting things; the word “millionaire” is not the wine of everything - not a millionaire himself, but one word; For in one sound of this word, there is something that acts on the people of the scoundrels, and on people of the good people and the good people, in a word, acts on everyone. The millionaire has the benefit that the meanness can see, completely disinterested, pure meanness, not based on any calculations: many people know very well that they will not receive anything from him and have no right to get, but they will certainly run forward, even laugh at him, even laugh at him , at least they will take off their hat, at least they will ask for no dinner where they find out that the millionaire is invited. This is not to say that this tender arrangement to meanness was felt by the ladies; However, in many living rooms they began to say that, of course, Chichikov is not the first handsome man, but such as it should be a man, that if he were a little thicker or more complete, it would be bad. At the same time, it was somehow said even a little offensive about a thin man: that he is nothing more, like something like a toothpick, not a person. Many different additions were in the ladies' outfits. In the Gostiny Dvor there was a crush, almost a crush; Even a walk was formed, to such an extent it ran into crews. The merchants were amazed, seeing how several pieces of matters brought by them from the fair and did not get away due to the price that seemed high, they suddenly went into operation and the rejuvenation were sold out. During the impoveris, one of the ladies noticed such a roll at the bottom of the dress, [55] which spent him on polish, so that the private bailiff, who was right there, gave the order to move to the people far away, that is, closer to the porch, so that the toilet would not be silent somehow Her high -blessed. Even Chichikov himself could not partially notice such extraordinary attention. Once, returning to his home, he found a letter on his table; Where and who brought him, nothing could be recognized; The tavern servant responded that they brought it and did not tell me to say from whom. The letter began very decisively, exactly like that: "No, I have to write to you!" Then it was said that there was a secret sympathy between the souls; This truth was fastened with several points, which took almost half a hundred; Then there were several thoughts that were very remarkable in justice, so we consider it almost necessary to write them out: “What is our life? - The valley where sorrow settled. What is the light? “A crowd of people who do not feel.” Then the writer mentioned that she rejuvenated the lines of a tender mother, who, flowed for twenty -five years, as no longer exists in the world; Chichikov was invited to the desert, to leave forever a city where people in stuffy fences do not use air; The end of the letter spoke even with a decisive despair and was the following verses:

Two throats will show

You are my cold ashes.

Vorky languidly, they will say

That she died in tears.

There was no size in the last line, but this, however, is nothing: the letter was written in the spirit of the then time. There was no signature either: neither a name, nor a surname, nor even a month and a number. Postscriptum [56] was only added that his own heart should guess the written and that the original of the governor who has to be tomorrow will be attended by the original.

It interested him very much. In the anonym, there was so much tempting and inciting curiosity that he was resting both for another and for the third time a letter and finally said: “It would be curious, however, to know who was such a written!” In a word, the matter, apparently, became sorovably; For more than an hour, he was all thinking about this, finally, spread his hands and tilting his head, said: “But the letter is very, very curly written!” Then, of course, the letter was curtailed and put in the box, in the neighborhood with what a poster and an invitation wedding ticket, which had been preserved in the same position and in the same place for seven years. A little later they brought to him, for sure, an invitation to the ball to the governor - a very ordinary matter in the provincial cities: where the governor, there, there is a ball, otherwise there will be no proper love and respect from the nobility.

All strangers were left and removed away at the same moment, and everything was directed to prepare for the ball; For, for sure, there were a lot of incentive and lifting reasons. But, perhaps, from the very creation of light, no time was used on the toilet. The whole hour was dedicated only to one examination of a person in the mirror. I tried to inform him of many different expressions: either important and steppe, then respectful, but with some smile, then just respectful without a smile; Several bow was released in the mirror, accompanied by obvious sounds, partly similar to French, although Chichikov did not know at all in French. He even made himself a lot of pleasant surprises, winked at an eyebrow and lips and did something even with his tongue; In a word, you never do not do anything, left alone, feeling that it is good, and besides, being sure that no one looks into the crack. Finally, he fluttered slightly on his chin, saying: "Oh, you are a muzzle like!" - And he began to dress. The most satisfied location accompanied him during the entire time of dressing: putting on a lift or tieing a tie, he rumbled and bowed with particular dexterity and although he never danced, he did Antrash. This Antrash produced a small innocent consequence: a chest of drawers trembled, and a brush fell from the table.

Its appearance on the ball took an extraordinary action. Everything that was, turned to meet him, who with the cards in his hands, who at the most interesting point of the conversation uttered: “And the Lower Zemsky Court answers it ...”, but what is the Zemstvo court, he threw it to the side and this He was in a hurry with a greeting to our hero. “Pavel Ivanovich! Oh my god, Pavel Ivanovich! My dear Pavel Ivanovich! The respective Pavel Ivanovich! My soul, Pavel Ivanovich! Here you are, Pavel Ivanovich! Here he is, our Pavel Ivanovich! Let me press you, Pavel Ivanovich! Let him go here, so I will kiss him stronger, my dear Pavel Ivanovich! ” Chichikov at once felt in a few arms. I did not have time to completely get out of the chair of the chairman, as he found himself already in the arms of the police chief; The police officer handed it over to the inspector of the medical council; The inspector of the medical council - the farmer, the unit - the architect ... the governor, who at that time stood near the ladies and held a confident ticket in one hand, and in the other Bolonok, seeing him, threw a ticket and a bolon on the floor, - only the dog screeched; In a word, he spread the joy and fun of the extraordinary. There was no face on which pleasure would not be expressed or, at least, a reflection of universal pleasure. This happens on the faces of officials during the inspection by the boss entrusted to the management of their seats: after the first fear was already passing, they saw that he liked a lot, and he himself finally deigned to joke, that is, to say a few words with a pleasant grin. The officials who surrounded him in response to this are laughed in response; Those who, however, have somewhat poorly heard the words they said, and, finally, far from the door at the very exit, some policeman who did not laugh through his lifetime and just showing a fist before that people, and that one According to the unchanging laws of reflection, he expresses some smile on his face, although this smile is more similar to how someone was going to sneeze after strong tobacco. Our hero answered everyone and everyone and felt some unusual dexterity: he bowed to the right and left, as usual to his side, but completely free, so he fascinated everyone. The ladies immediately surrounded him with a brilliant garland and delivered whole clouds of all kinds of fragrances with them: one breathed roses, from the other carried in spring and violets, the third was blurred through his razheda; Chichikov raised only his nose up and sniffed. In the outfits, their taste was an abyss: Muslims, Atlases, Kisei were such pale fashionable colors as even names could not be taken (the subtlety of taste came to such an extent). Ribbon bows and flower bouquets fluttered there and there on dresses in the most picture mess, although a decent head worked on this mess. A light headdress kept only on the ears alone and, it seemed, said: “Hey, I will, it is a pity that I would not raise a beauty with me!” The waists were covered and had the strongest and most pleasant eyes for the eyes (it should be noted that in general all the ladies of the city of N. were somewhat full, but they launched so skillfully and had such a pleasant appeal that the thickness could not be noted). Everything was invented and provided with unusual examination; The neck, shoulders were open as much as necessary, and no further; Each revealed its possessions until she felt in her own conviction that they were able to destroy a person; The rest was hidden with an unusual taste: either some light tie made of tape, or a scarf is easier than a cake, known under the name “kiss”, embraced his neck, or were released from behind the shoulders, under the dress, small gear walls from The thin batist, known by the name of "modesty." These “modesty” hid in front and behind what could no longer inflict the death of a person, but meanwhile they made them suspect that it was precisely that the most died. Long gloves were worn out not up to the sleeves, but deliberately left the exciting parts of the hands higher than the elbow, which were breathed with enviable fullness; Like gloves even burst in others, encouraged to move further - in a word, it seems, as if it were written on everything: no, this is not a province, this is the capital, this is Paris itself! Only in some places some caps not seen by the earth suddenly protruded or even some kind of peacock feather into the opposite of all mods, to their own taste. But without this it is impossible, such is the property of the provincial city: somewhere it will certainly break off. Chichikov, standing in front of them, thought: "Which, however, the writer of the letter?" - and stuck forward his nose; But on the very nose, a number of elbows, cuffs, sleeves, ends of ribbons, fragrant shemizatoks and dresses pulled it. The halopad flew to the whole lifting: the postmaster, the captain-officer, the lady with a blue pen, the lady with a white pen, the Georgian prince Chiphaykhilidzev, an official from St. Petersburg, the official from Moscow, the Frenchman Kuku, Perkhunovsky, Berebendovsky-everything rose and swept ...

- Won! I went to write the province! - Chichikov said, backing back, and as soon as the ladies sat down in places, he began to peek again: is it possible to find out in his face and in his eyes to find out who was the writer; But it was impossible to find out either in the face or in the expression in the eyes that was the writer. Everywhere it was noticeable such a slightly discovered, so elusively thin, y! How thin! .. “No,” Chichikov said in himself, “women, this is such an object ...” “Here he waved his hand:“ There is nothing to say just! ” Go and try to tell or convey everything that runs on their faces, all those radiation, hints-but you just won’t give anything. Some eyes are such an endless state into which a man drove - and remember what they called! Already from there, not crocheted, you can’t pull it out. Well, try, for example, to tell one shine of them: wet, velvet, sugar. God knows what is not yet! And hard, and soft, and even completely languid, or, as others say, in the bliss, or without bliss, but more than in the bliss - so he will hook in the heart, and leads all over his soul, as if with a bow. No, you just won’t get a word: the gallant half of the human race, and nothing more! ”

To blame! It seems that a word, noticed on the street, flew out of the mouth of our hero. What to do? This is the position of the writer in Rus'! However, if the word from the street fell into the book, the writer is not to blame, readers are to blame, and above all readers of high society: you will not hear a single decent Russian word from them, and they will probably end up with French, German and English, in such quantities. What you won’t want to, and they will even end up with all possible pronunciations: in French in the nose and burping, they will say in English in English, and even physiognomy will make a bird, and even laugh at who does not manage to make bird physiognomy; But only they will not end up the Russians, unless they will build a hut in Russian taste from patriotism for themselves. That's what are the readers of the highest class, and behind them all those who owe themselves to the highest class! Meanwhile, what a exactingness! They certainly want everything to be written by the most strict, cleansed and noble language - in a word, they want the Russian language to suddenly fall from the clouds, processed properly, and would have sat down directly on their tongue, and they would have nothing more, as soon as they would have any more than Growing your mouths and put it up. Of course, the female half of the human race is wise; But venerable readers, I must admit, are even wiser.

And Chichikov, meanwhile, came into perplexity to decide, which of the ladies was the writer of the letter. Having tried to rush more carefully, he saw that something like that, who was sent together, and sweet torment in the heart of the poor mortal, that he finally said: “No, you can’t guess it!” This, however, did not reduce the cheerful mood in which he was. He was at ease and deftly exchanged with some of the ladies pleasant words, approached both with a fractional, small step, or, as they say, was seeded with legs, as the little old -heeled old man in high heels, called mouse stallions, running very agilely near the ladies. Having stumbled with rather dexterous turns right and left, he rumbled right away a leg in the form of a short tail or as a comma. The ladies were very pleased and not only found a bunch of amenities and courtesies in him, but even began to find a magnificent expression in the face, something even Marse and military, which, as you know, really like women. Even because of him, they already began to quarrel somewhat: having noticed that he was usually standing near the doors, some in a hurry were in a hurry to take a chair closer to the door, and when one was lucky to do this before, it almost did not happen an unpleasant story, and many who wanted to do that The same, already too disgusting seemed like such impudence.

Chichikov took up the conversations with the ladies, or, better, the ladies occupied him so much with their conversations, pouring a bunch of the most intricate and subtle allegories that had to be solved, why even performed sweat on his forehead - that he forgot to fulfill the duty And come first to the mistress. He remembered this already when he heard the voice of the governor himself, who had been in front of him for several minutes. The governor uttered somewhat affectionate and slyly shaking her head: “Ah, Pavel Ivanovich, so how are you! ..” I just can’t convey the words of the governor, but something was performed by great courtesy, in the spirit in which the spirit in which the spirit The ladies and gentlemen in the stories of our secular writers, hunters to describe living rooms and boast of knowledge of the highest tone, in the spirit of the fact that "they really took possession of your heart in it, that there is no more place or the most close corner for ruthlessly forgotten by you." Our hero turned at that moment to the governor and was ready to let her go, probably no worse than those who are released in fashionable stories, Linsky, Lidins, Gremina and all sorts of dexterous military people, as by chance, raising his eyes, suddenly stopped, stopped, stopped, As if stunned by a blow.

There was more than one governor in front of him: she held a young sixteen -year -old girl, a fresh blonde with thin and slender features of her face, with a sharp chin, with a charmingly rounded oval of her face, which artist would take into a sample for the Madonna and what only a rare occasion came across in Rus' where he likes to be wide in size, everything that is: mountains and forests and steppes, faces and lips and legs; The same blonde that he met on the road, traveling from Nozdrev, when, by stupidity of coachmen or horses, their crews collided so strangely, messing around the harness, and Uncle Mitya and Uncle Minyai undertook to unravel the matter. Chichikov was so mixed that he could not say a single sensible word, and muttered the devil knows what it is, which would never say neither Gremin, nor Zvonsky, nor Lidin.

“You don't know my daughter yet?” - said the governor, - Institute, just released.

He replied that he had already had a happiness in a non -commissioned way to get acquainted; I tried to add something else, but something did not work out at all. The governor, having said two or three words, finally moved with her daughter to the other end of the hall to the other guests, and Chichikov was still motionless in the same place as a man who had fun went out into the street in order to walk, with his eyes, with his eyes. Located to look at everything, and suddenly stopped motionlessly, remembering that he had forgotten something and then there could be nothing more stupid as a person: an instantly carefree expression flies from his face; He is trying to recall that he has forgotten - is it not a scarf? but a scarf in a pocket; Isn't the money? But the money is also in his pocket, everything seems to be with him, but meanwhile some unknown spirit whispers into his ears that he has forgotten something. And now he looks at a bewildered and vaguely at the moving crowd in front of him, at the flying crews, on Kiver and guns of the passing regiment, on the sign - and does not see anything well. So Chichikov suddenly became alien to everything that happened around him. At this time, a lot of hints and questions that were imbued with subtlety and courtesy were rushed from lady incense lips to him. "Is it allowed to be the poor inhabitants of the Earth, to be so impudent as to ask you, what do you dream of?" “Where are the happy places in which your thought flutters?” “Can you know the name of the one that plunged you into this sweet valley of thoughtfulness?” But he answered everything with decisive inattention, and pleasant phrases sunk, as if in water. He was even so unaccounted for that he soon left them in the other direction, wanting to get a dial where the governor with his daughter went. But the ladies, it seems, did not want to leave him so soon; Each inwardly decided to use all kinds of tools, so dangerous for our hearts, and launch everything that was the best. It should be noted that some of the ladies-I say to some, this is not what everyone has-there is a little weakness: if they notice something especially good in themselves, whether the forehead, the mouth, their hands, then they already think that the best part of their face is so the first and will be thrown into the eyes and everyone will suddenly speak in one voice: “Look, look, what a wonderful Greek nose is!” Or: "What a correct, charming forehead!" Who is good for the shoulders, she is sure in advance that all young people will be completely delighted and now and then they will repeat at a time when she passes by: “Ah, how wonderful this shoulders” - and on the face, hair, hair, hair The nose, the forehead will not even look, if they look, then as something extraneous. Thus other ladies think. Each lady gave herself an inner vow to be as charming in dancing and showing in all the splendor the superiority of what she had the most excellent. The postmaster, whipping, with such languor lowered her head to the side that something was really heard. One very kind lady - who came not at all with dancing, because of the short, as she herself expressed, a small incomite [57] in the form of a pea on her right leg, as a result of which she should even put on plate boots - she did not last, but the same And she made several circles in plate boots, so that the postmaster would not really take too much to her head.

But all this did not produce the alleged action on Chichikov. He did not even look at the circles produced by the ladies, but constantly rose to the tiptoe to peep over their heads, where the entertaining blonde could climb; He crouched down, too, looking out between his shoulders and spin, finally finished off and saw her, sitting with his mother, over whom some eastern turban with a pen hesitated. It seemed as if he wanted to take them by an attack; Whether the spring was the location to act on him, or who pushed him from behind, only he was impatiently forward, no matter what; The incident received such a push from him that he staggered and resisted a little on one leg, or would, of course, tumbled behind him a whole series; The postmaster also stepped back and looked at him with amazement mixed with rather subtle irony, but he did not look at them; He saw only in the distance a blonde who puts on a long glove and, without a doubt, burned down the desire to start flying on the parquet. And there, aside, four pairs were jerking off the mazurka; The heels broke the floor, and the army staff captain worked both with his soul and body, and with his hands and legs, turning off such paran, which no one happened to turn away in a dream. Chichikov piled past the mazurka almost in the heels and right to the place where the governor and daughter were sitting. However, he approached them very timidly, did not seed so briskly and frantic legs, even hesitated somewhat, and in all movements there was some kind of awkwardness.

It is probably that the feeling of love was certainly awakened in our hero - even doubtful that the gentlemen of this kind, that is, not so fat, but not that thin, were capable of love; But with all that, there was something so strange, something like that, which he himself could not explain to himself: it seemed to him how he himself later confessed that the whole ball, with all his dialect and noise, became several minutes, as if in the distance; Hidden and pipes were cut somewhere around the mountains, and everything was twisted with a fog, similar to a carelessly lured field in the picture. And only only thin features of a fascinating blonde came out of this hammered, somehow sketched field: her oval-stirred face, her thin, thin camp, which happens in the institution in the first months after the release, her white, almost simple dress, Easily and cleverly wrapping in all places young slender members, which were meant in some clean lines. It seemed that she was all like some kind of toy, clearly carved from the ivory; She only was white and came out of a transparent and light from a muddy and opaque crowd.

It can be seen that it happens in the world; Apparently, the Chichikovs for several minutes in their lives turn to poets; But the word "poet" will already be too much. At least he felt completely like a young man, a little bit of a hussar. Seeing an empty chair near them, he immediately took him. The conversation did not glue at first, but after the matter went, and he even began to receive force, but ... Here, to the greatest regret, it must be noted that people are sedate and important positions are somehow a little heavy in conversations with the ladies; For this, the master of the Lord is guarantees and no further than the captain’s ranks. As they do, God knows them: it seems, and not very tricky things say, and the girl now and then sways in a chair from laughter; The state adviser God knows what he will tell: either he will lead to the fact that Russia is a very lengthy state, or will release a compliment, which, of course, is invented not without wit, but it smells of a book terribly; If he says something funny, then he himself incomparably laughs more than the one that listens to him. Here this is noticed so that readers see why the blonde began to yawn during the stories of our hero. The hero, however, did not notice this at all, telling a lot of pleasant things that he had already pronounced in such cases in different places: it was in the Simbirsk province of Sofron Ivanovich the Careless, where his daughter Adelaid Sofronovna with three sills: Marya Gavrilovna, was then. Alexandra Gavrilovna and Adeelgade Gavrilovna; Fyodor Fedorovich Otleyv in the Ryazan province; Frol Vasilievich Pobedonnotnoy in the Penza province and his brother Peter Vasilyevich, where his own martyr was his own martyr Katerina Mikhailovna and the grandchildren of her sisters Roza Fedorovna and Emilia Fedorovna; In the Vyatka province at Peter Barsnofievich, where there was a sister of his daughter -in -law Pelageya Egorovna with his niece Sofia Rostislavsky and two half -sisters - Sofia Alexandrovna and Maklature Alexandrovna.

All ladies did not like this bypass of Chichikov at all. One of them deliberately passed him to let him notice it, and even hit the blonde with a rather carelessly thick roll of her dress, and the scarf that fluttered around her shoulders ordered that he waved his end to his own face; At the same time, behind him from the same ladies' lips, along with the smell of violets, a rather sharp and stinging remark. But, either he did not hear in reality, or pretended that he did not hear, only it was not good, because the opinion of the ladies needs to be cherished: he repented, but after, after, he was too late.

Nonsense, in all respects fair, was portrayed in many faces. No matter how great Chichikov’s weight was in society, although he was both a millionaire and his face expressed greatness and even something Marse and military, but there are things that the ladies will not forgive anyone, if whoever he may be, and then write directly Lossed! There are cases where a woman, no matter how weak and powerless in a character in comparison with a man, but suddenly becomes more firm not only of men, but everything that is in the world. The neglect of Chichikov, almost unintentional, restored even the consent between the ladies, which was on the edge of the death on the occasion of the seizure of a chair. In the accidentally pronounced dry and ordinary words, they found sharp hints. To top it off, some of the young people immediately composed satirical poems to the dancing society, without which, as you know, it almost never costs the provincial balls. These verses were attributed to Chichikov right there. The indignation grew, and the ladies began to talk about him in different corners in the most unfavorable way; And the poor institution was completely destroyed, and her sentence was already signed.

Meanwhile, an unpleasant surprise was preparing for our hero: at the time when the blonde was yawning, and he told her some stories that had happened at different times, and even touched the Greek philosopher Diogenes, the nostril seemed from the last room. He escaped from the buffet or from a small green living room, where the game was made stronger than in an ordinary whist, whether with his will or pushed him out, only he appeared cheerful, joyful, grabbing the prosecutor’s hand, which he probably had already dragged some time, because That the poor prosecutor turned his thick eyebrows on all directions, as if inventing a means to get out of this friendly improvised journey. In fact, it was unbearable. Nozdrev, choking the courage in two cups of tea, of course not without Roma, lied mercilessly. Seeing him still from afar, Chichikov decided even to a donation, that is, to leave his enviable place and how much it could be more hastily left: this meeting did not foresee anything good to him. But, as trouble, at that time the governor turned up, who expressed the extraordinary joy that Pavel Ivanovich found, and stopped him, asking him to be a judgment in his dispute with two ladies about whether female love is long or not; Meanwhile, Nozdrev already saw him and walked right to meet him.

- Ah, Kherson landowner, Kherson landowner! He shouted, approaching and flooding with a laughter, from which his fresh, ruddy cheeks were trembling, like a spring rose. - What? Injected a lot of the dead? After all, you do not know, your Excellency, ”he throat right away, turning to the governor,“ he sells dead souls! ” By God! Listen, Chichikov! After all, you,-I tell you by friendship, here we are all your friends here, here is his Excellency here-I would hang you, by golly, hanging you!

Chichikov simply did not know where he was sitting.

“Believe your Excellency,” Knozdrev continued, “as he told me:“ Sell dead souls, ”I burst with laughter. I come here, they tell me that I bought three million peasants to the conclusion: what the conclusion! Yes, he traded the dead with me. Listen, Chichikov, you are cattle, by golly, cattle, here is his excellency here, isn't it, is the prosecutor?

But the prosecutor, and Chichikov, and the governor himself came into such confusion that they did not find absolutely that to answer, but meanwhile nostril, not paying attention to at all, carried a half -sober speech:

“You, brother, you, you ... I won’t get away from you until I find out why you bought dead souls.” Listen, Chichikov, because you, right, are ashamed, you, you yourself know, there is no better friend like me. Here is his Excellency here, isn't it, the prosecutor? You won’t believe it, your Excellency, how we are attached to each other, that is, just if you said, here, I am standing here, and you would say: “Nozdrev! Tell me, who is more expensive for you, the father of the native or Chichikov? " -I will say: “Chichikov”, by golly ... Let me, soul, I will put you one meringue. [58] Already let your Excellency, to kiss it for me. Yes, Chichikov, you don’t bother you, let one moth allow you to print you in the snow -white cheek!

Nozdrev was so pushed off with his meringue that he almost flew to the ground: everyone retreated from him and did not listen anymore; But still, his words about the purchase of dead souls were uttered in full throat and accompanied by such a loud laugh that they attracted the attention of even those that were in the farthest corners of the room. This news seemed strange that everyone stopped with some kind of wooden, stupid-questioning expression. Chichikov noticed that many ladies were moving among themselves with what kind of malicious, caustic grin and in the expression of some people there was something so ambiguous that further increased this embarrassment. That the nostrough liar is notorious, it was known to everyone, and it was not at all a curiosity to hear a decisive nonsense from him; But mortal, right, is difficult to even understand how this mortal works: no matter how the news goes, but if only it was news, he will certainly inform her to another mortal, if only for just to say: “Look at what lies what a lie Dissolled! " - And the other mortal will delight the ear with pleasure, although after he himself will say: “Yes, this is a completely vulgar lie that is not worth any attention!” - And after that time he will go to look for the third mortal, so that, having told him, after that with him exclaim with noble indignation: “What a vulgar lie!” And this will certainly bypass the whole city, and all mortals, no matter how many of them are, will certainly speak and then admit that this is not worth attention and not worthy to talk about it.

This absurd, apparently, the incident noticeably upset our hero. No matter how stupid the words of the fool, and sometimes they are sufficient to confuse a smart person. He began to feel embarrassed, wrong: exactly, as if as if a beautifully cleaned boot, he suddenly entered a dirty, smelly puddle; In a word, not good, it’s not at all! He tried not to think about it, tried to scatter, entertained, sat down in whist, but everything went like a crooked wheel: he went into someone else's suit and, having forgotten that they didn’t beat the third, swung from the whole hand and grabbed his foolishly. The chairman could not understand how Pavel Ivanovich, so good and, one might say, a subtlely reasonable game, could make such mistakes and let even under the butt of his peak king, to whom he, in his own expression, hoped, as for God. Of course, the postmaster and the chairman and even the police officer himself, as usual, joked at our hero, that he was not in love and what we know, they say that Pavel Ivanovich is limping, we know who and he is shot; But all this did not console him in any way, no matter how he tried to grin and joke. At dinner, too, he was in no way able to turn around, despite the fact that the society at the table was pleasant and that Nosdreva had long been taken out; For even the ladies themselves finally noticed that his behavior was too scandalous. In the middle of the cotillon, he sat on the floor and began to grab onto the floors of the dancers, which was already not like anything, in the words of the ladies. Dinner was very cheerful, all the faces that flashed in front of triple candlesticks, flowers, confection and bottles were illuminated by the most laid -back contentment. Officers, ladies, tailcoats - everything happened kindly, even before cloying. Men jumped up from chairs and fled to take away the dishes from the servants in order to offer them to the ladies with unusual dexterity. One colonel handed the lady a plate with a sauce at the end of a naked sword. The men of the respectable years, between whom Chichikov sat, argued loudly, jamming a practical word with fish or beef, dipped in a merciless way into mustard, and argued about those objects in which he even always took part; But he looked like some kind of man, tired or broken by a long road, to whom nothing climbs into mind and who is not able to enter into anything. He did not even wait for the end of dinner and went to himself incomparably earlier than he used to leave.

There, in this room, so familiar to the reader, with a door caught by a chest of drawers, and sometimes peering out of the corners of cockroaches, the position of thoughts and spirit was as restless as the seats in which he sat. It was unpleasant, vaguely in his heart, some painful emptiness remained there. “So that the devil has bought you everyone who invented these balls! He said in his hearts. - Well, what were the foolishly delighted? In the province, crop failure, high cost, so they are for balls! EC LITTLE: Discharged into women's rags! Invalid that the other one has come on a thousand rubles! But at the expense of peasant fragments or, even worse, at the expense of our brother's conscience. After all, it is known why you take a bribe and shout in your soul: in order to get a wife on a shawl or on different robes, take them a failure, as they are called. And from what? In order not to say some sub-Sidorovna that the postmaster was better than a dress, and because of her a thousand rubles. They shout: “Ball, ball, fun!” - just rubbish the ball, not in the Russian spirit, not in Russian nature; The devil knows what it is: an adult, an adult suddenly jumps out in black, plunged, covered as a devil, and let's knead with your feet. Even, standing in pairs, it speaks with another about an important matter, and with his legs at the same time as a goat, a monogram to the right and left ... All from monkey, everything from monkey! That the Frenchman at forty years old is the same child as he was at fifteen, so let's come on! No, right ... After every ball, it was as if what sin had made; And I don’t even want to remember about him. There is simply nothing in my head, as after a conversation with a secular person: he will say everything, he will touch it slightly, he will say everything that he tucked up from the books, variegated, red, and at least he took out something from that, and then you see, as even as even A conversation with a simple merchant who knows one of his own business, but knowing him firmly and experienced, better than all these trinkets. Well, what will you squeeze out of it, from this ball? Well, if, let's put, some writer decided to describe the whole scene as it is? Well, in the book, and there it would be as stupid as in kind. What is it: is it moral, immoral? Just the devil knows what it is! Play, and then close the book. ” So spoke unfavorable Chichikov about balls in general; But, it seems, another reason for indignation intervened here. The main annoyance was not on the ball, but on the fact that it happened to him to break, that he suddenly seemed to everyone, God knows in what form, that he played some strange, ambiguous role. Of course, looking at the eye of a prudent person, he saw that all this is nonsense, that nothing means a stupid word, especially now that the main thing is already turned up properly. But a man is strange: he was upset by the very non -use of those that he did not respected and about which he spoke sharply, awakening their fuss and outfits. It was all the more annoying to him that, having examined the matter clearly, he saw how the reason for this was partly himself. He, however, was not angry with himself, and, of course, he was right. We all have little weakness to spare ourselves a little, and we will try to make some neighbor better, on whom to find out of our annoyance, for example, on a servant, on an official, to us a subordinate who, at the time, turned up, on his wife or, finally, in a chair, who throws the devil knows where, to the very door, so the pen and back will fly away from him: let him say he knows what anger is. So Chichikov soon found his neighbor, who dragged everything that he could inspire him on his shoulders. This nostril was near this, and there was nothing to say, it was so finished from all sides and sides, as if only some kind of a rogue of the headman or the coachman was trimmed with some kind of rode, an experienced captain, and sometimes a general who, beyond many expressions that made it made Classical, adds many more unknown people, whom the invention belongs to him actually. The entire genealogy of Nozdreva was dismantled, and many of the members of his surname were greatly suffered in the ascending line.

But in continuation of how he was sitting in his hard chairs, disturbed by thoughts and insomnia, treating his diligently nosdrev and his whole relatives, and in front of him was a sebaceous candle, which the lamp had long been covered with a black hat, threatening to go out, and looked at him in The windows are a blind, dark night, ready to turn blue from the approaching dawn, and remote roosters were swinging away, and in a completely sleeping city, maybe somewhere a frisial overcoat was trampled, the grief is unknown what class and rank, knowing only one (alas!) The road by the Russian frozen people - at that time, an event took place on the other side of the city, which was preparing to increase the trouble of the situation of our hero. It was, in the remote streets and nooks of the city, a very strange crew rattled, which was bewildered about his name. He did not look like a tarantass, nor a stroller, or a Brichka, but rather looked like a sweatshirt, a convex watermelon put on wheels. The cheeks of this watermelon, that is, the doors that wore traces of yellow paint, shut up very poorly because of the poor condition of the handles and locks, somehow connected by ropes. The watermelon was filled with chintz pillows in the form of pouches, rollers and just pillows, stuffed with bags of bread, kalachi, cookies, [59] Feculomas and rolls of pre -car dough. Curric pie and darkeeper peeped even up. The commas were occupied by the face of lackey descent, in a jacket from a pestle, with an unshaven beard, pulled out with a light gray, - a face known under the name “small”. The noise and screech from iron brackets and rusty screws woke up on the other end of the city of the booth, which, raising his halberd, cried out the awareness of what the urine became: "Who is coming?" -But, seeing that no one was going on, but only a ratt was heard in the distance, he caught a beast on his collar and, approaching the lantern, executed him immediately on his nail. After which, having settled the halberd, he again fell asleep through the charters of his chivalry. The horses now and then fell on the front knees, because they were not subsidized, and, apparently, the deceased city pavement was not familiar with them. Kolymaga, having made several turns from the street to the street, finally turned in the dark lane past the small parish church of Nikola on the shortcuts and stopped before the gates of Protopopsha’s house. The girl got out of the Brichka, with a handkerchief on her head, in a quilted jacket, and grabbed with both fists into the gate so much, even if a man (small in a pestlers' jacket [60] was then stuck on his legs, because he was sleeping dead). The dogs barked, and the gate, having finally swept, swallowed, albeit with great difficulty, this is a clumsy road work. The crew drove into a tight courtyard, littered with firewood, chicken coins and all sorts of cells; The lady got out of the crew: this lady was a landowner, a college secretary box. The old woman soon after the departure of our hero came to such anxiety about the deception that could happen from his deception, that, without having to sleep for three nights, she decided to go to the city, despite the fact that the horses were not upset, and there are probably dead souls and there are likely, how much did it go Whether she has missed, God save, selling them, maybe Vechesev. What the investigation this arrival made, the reader can find out from one conversation that occurred between one two ladies. This conversation ... But let this conversation be better in the next chapter.

Chapter Ninth

In the morning, earlier even that time, which is scheduled in the city of N. For visits, from the doors of an orange wooden house with a mesonin and blue columns, a lady in a fiber dandy clock, [61], accompanied by a footman with several collars and a golden galloon in a round, a rounded hat . The lady fluttered at the same hour with an unusual haste for the steps thrown into the stroller standing at the entrance. The footman immediately slammed the lady with the doors, threw the steps and, grabbing the belts from behind the stroller, screamed to the coachman: “He went!” The lady brought the news that he had just heard and felt the indiscretion of the irresistible rather to inform her. She peered out of the window every minute and saw, to an unspeakable annoyance that it was still halfway. Every house seemed to her longer than ordinary; The white stone almshouse with narrow windows stretched unbearably for a long time, so she finally could not say not to say: “The damned structure, and there is no end!” Kucher already received the order twice: “Hurry, as soon as possible, Andryushka! You have been going for a long time today! " Finally, the goal was achieved. The stroller stopped in front of a wooden one-story house of a dark gray color, with white bas-reliefs above the windows, with a high wooden lattice in front of the windows and a narrow front garden, behind which the resented trees turned away from the urban dust that had never left them. Pots with flowers flashed in the windows, a parrot swinging in a cage, clutching his nose behind the ring, and two dogs that fell in front of the sun. A sincere friend of the arrived lady lived in this house. The author is extremely difficult to call him both ladies in such a way that they would not get angry with him again, as they were getting up. It is dangerous to call a fictional surname. Whatever the name is, there will certainly be in some corner of our state, good, someone who wears it, and will certainly be angry not on the stomach, but to death, will say that the author deliberately came secretly in order to find out All that he is himself, and in what a sheepskin coat he goes, and which Agrafena Ivanovna visits, and that he likes to eat. What are the ranks - God save, and it’s more dangerous. Now we have all the ranks and classes so annoyed that everything that is in the printed book already seems to them a person: this is already apparently the location in the air. It is enough to say only that there is a stupid person in one city, this is already a person; Suddenly, the master of respectable appearance jumps out and shouts: “After all, I am also a person, therefore, I am also stupid,” in a word, instantly will realize what the matter is. And therefore, in order to avoid all this, we will call the lady to whom the guest came, as she was called almost unanimously in the city of N.: Namely, the lady pleasant in all respects. She acquired this name legally, because, for sure, she did not regret anything to become kindly to the last extent, although, of course, through the courtesy, wow, what a nimble agility of a female character! And although sometimes in every pleasant word it was sticking out, what a pin! And God forbid that it was boiling in the heart against the one that would climb somehow and with something in the first. But all this was clothed with the very subtle secularity, which only happens in the provincial city. She produced every movement with taste, even loved poetry, even sometimes dreamily knew how to keep her head - and everyone agreed that she, for sure, was a pleasant lady in every way. Another lady, that is, who arrived, did not have such multilaterality in character, and therefore we will call her: just a pleasant lady. The arrival of the guest woke up the dogs who slept in the sun: the furry Adele, who was constantly confused in his own wool, and the male of the praise on thin legs. One and the other with barking their tails carried their tails into the front, where the guest was freed from their shock and found himself in the dress of a fashionable pattern and color and in long tails on his neck: the jasmines rushed throughout the room. As soon as in all respects, a pleasant lady found out about the arrival of just a pleasant lady, as she already ran into the front. The ladies grabbed their hands, kissed and cried out, how the institutes cried out, who met shortly after the release, when the Mameni had not yet managed to explain to them that the father of one was poorer and lower than that of the other. The kiss took place loudly because the little dogs got down again, for which they were slammed with a handkerchief, and both ladies went to the living room, of course, the blue, with a sofa, an oval table and even widths entwined with ivy; Following them ran, grumbling, shaggy Adele and high praise on thin legs. “Here, here, here in this corner! - said the hostess, seating the guest into the corner of the sofa. - Like this! like this! Here you have a pillow! " Having said this, she stuffed a pillow behind her, on which the knight was embroidered with her hair in such a way that they were always embroidered along the canvas: the nose came out of the staircase, and her lips are a four -circuit. “How glad I am that you ... I hear someone drove up, but I think for myself who could have so early. Parasha says: “Vice-Governor”, ​​and I say: “Well, again, a fool came to bother”, and I wanted to say that I was not at home ... ”

The guest already wanted to get down to business and inform the news. But the exclamation that the lady pleasant in all respects made at that time suddenly gave another direction to the conversation.

- What a cheerful chintz! - the pleasant lady exclaimed in every way, looking at the dress just a pleasant lady.

- Yes, very funny. Praskovya Fedorovna, however, finds that it was better if the cells were smaller, and so that there were no brown specks, but blue. Her sister was sent to the material: this is such a charm that cannot be expressed in words; Imagine for yourself: strips are narrow-skinny, which can imagine the imagination of human, the background of the blue and through the strip all the eyes and paws, eyes and legs, eyes and legs ... in a word, incomparable! We can say decisively that there was nothing like that yet.

- Honey, it is colorful.

- Ah no, not variegated.

- Ah, variegated!

It should be noted that in all respects a pleasant lady was partly a materialist, prone to denial and doubt and rejected a lot in life.

Here, just a pleasant lady explained that this was by no means colorful, and cried out:

- Yes, I congratulate you: they no longer wear a frill.

- How are they not worn?

- Their scisters in place.

- Ah, it's not good, scisters!

- Festonychiki, all the scisters: pestonchiks pelerinka, festonychiki on the sleeves, epipotists from scisters, below are scisters, everywhere scisters.

- Not good, Sofya Ivanovna, if all the scisters.

- Milo, Anna Grigoryevna, to incredibility; It sews in two scarves: wide armholes and from above ... But now, when you are amazed, when you say that ... well, amaze: imagine, the bras went even longer, in front of the toe, and the front bone completely comes out of the borders; The whole skirt is gathering around, as it happened in the old days of Fizhma, [62], even at the back, is a little put in wool to be perfect underwear. [63]

- Well, it's simple: I admit! - said the lady pleasant in all respects, having made movement with a head with a sense of dignity.

“Exactly, this is exactly what I admit,” answered just a pleasant lady.

“As you want, I will never follow it.”

“I myself, too ... right, how to imagine what the fashion sometimes comes to ... It doesn't look like anything!” I asked my sister to the pattern on purpose for laughter; My melania began to sew.

- So do you have a pattern? - the pleasant lady cried out in every way, not without a noticeable heart move.

- Well, my sister brought.

- My soul, give it to me for the sake of everything saint.

- Ah, I already gave the floor to Praskovier Fedorovna. Is it after her.

- Who will be worn after Praskovya Fedorovna? It will be too strange on your part if you prefer yours.

“Why, she, too, to me a cousin.”

- She’s aunt, God still knows what: on the husband’s side ... no, Sofya Ivanovna, I don’t want to hear, it turns out: you want to give me such an insult ... Apparently, I got bored, apparently, you want to stop all my acquaintance with me .

Poor Sofya Ivanovna did not know at all what to do. She felt herself between what strong lights she put herself. So I boasted! She would be ready to sake a stupid tongue for it with needles.

- Well, what is our pretty? - Meanwhile said the lady pleasant in every way.

- Oh my god! Well, I'm so sitting in front of you! That's good! After all, you know, Anna Grigoryevna, with what did I come to you? - Then the guest’s breathing stumbled, the words, like hawks, were ready to go in pursuit of one after another, and only it was necessary to be so inhuman, what was a sincere friend to decide to stop her.

“No matter how you snatch and extol it,” she said with liveliness, more than usual, “and I’ll tell you directly, and I’ll tell him that he is an worthless person, worthless, unwritten, worthless ...

- Yes, only listen to that I will open you ...

- The rumors dismissed that he was good, and he was not good at all, not good at all, and his nose ... The most unpleasant nose.

- Let me, let me just tell you ... Darrot, Anna Grigoryevna, let me tell you! After all, this is a story, you understand: history, a skopel of the oustor, [64] - said the guest with an expression of almost despair and a completely imploring voice. It does not stop noticing that a lot of foreign words intervened in the conversation of both ladies and sometimes long French phrases. But no matter how fully fulfilled by the author of reverence for those saving benefits that the French language brings, no matter how he is fulfilled by reverence for the commendable custom of our higher society, which is explaining on it at all hours of day, of course, from a deep sense of love for the Fatherland, but with all that in no way It does not dare to make a phrase any kind of alien language into this Russian poem. So, we will continue in Russian.

- What is the story?

-Ah, my life, Anna Grigoryevna, if you could only imagine the position in which I was in, imagine: the protopopha-Protopopsha, father, wife, wife, come to me today-and what would you think: our humility, visiting- then ours, what, huh?

- How, did he really build chickens? [65]

- Ah, Anna Grigoryevna, even if there would have been chickens, it would be nothing yet; Listen only what Protopopsha said: she came, says, the landowner the box, frightened and pale as death, and tells, and as he says, listen only to a perfect romance; Suddenly at midnight, when everything was already sleeping in the house, a knock, the most terrible that can be imagined to yourself; shout: "Open, open, the gates will be broken out!" What will it seem to you? What is after that a liner?

- What a box, is it young and good by itself?

“Not at all, old woman.”

- Ah, charms! So he set about the old woman. Well, after that, the taste of our ladies is good after that, they found whom to fall in love with.

- But no, Anna Grigoryevna, not at all what you think. Imagine only what is armed from head to toe, like Rinald Rinaldin, [66] and demands: “Sell, says, all the souls that have died.” The box answers very reasonably, says: "I can’t sell, because they are dead." “No, he says, they are not dead, this is mine, says it is a matter of knowing whether they are dead or not, they are not dead, not dead, screaming, not dead.” In a word, the scandalosis made a terrible one: the whole village escaped, the children cry, everyone screams, no one understands anyone, well, just an orrer, an orrer, an orrer! .. [67] But you can’t imagine, Anna Grigoryevna, how I was rinsing when I heard all this. “Golubushka lady,” Masha tells me, “look in the mirror: you are pale.” “Not to the mirror, I say, I have to go to tell Anna Grigoryevna.” At that moment I order to lay the stroller: Kucher Andryushka asks me where to go, but I can’t say anything, I just look into his eyes, like a fool; I think he thought I was crazy. Ah, Anna Grigoryevna, if you could only imagine how I was rinsing!

“This, however, is strange,” the pleasant lady said in every way, “what can these dead souls mean?” I admit, I don’t understand anything here. For the second time, I hear everything about these dead souls; And my husband still says that Nozdrev is lying; There is something right.

- But imagine, Anna Grigoryevna, what was my position when I heard it. “And now,” says the box, “I don’t know, he says what to do. He forced, he says, to sign me some kind of fake paper, threw fifteen rubles in bank notes; I say, an inexperienced helpless widow, I know nothing ... ”So here is the incident! But only if you could imagine how I was overweight.

“But only, your will, there are not dead souls here, something else is hiding here.”

“I admit, too,” said, not without surprise, just a pleasant lady and immediately felt a strong desire to find out that this could hide here. She even said with the arrangement: - Well, do you think it is hiding here?

- Well, what do you think?

- How do I think? .. I admit, completely lost.

“But, however, I would like to know what are yours about this thought?”

But the pleasant lady was not found to say anything. She knew how to only worry, but in order to make up some vibrant assumption, for this it did not get it, and therefore, more than any other, she had a need for tender friendship and advice.

“Well, listen to what these dead souls are,” said the lady pleasant in all respects, and the guest, with such words, turned into a hearing: her ears stretched out by themselves, she raised herself, almost without sitting and holding on the sofa, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and Despite the fact that it was partially heavy, it suddenly became thorough, it looked like a light fluff, which will fly like this from the air from the Dunov.

So the Russian master, the dog and the Jora-hunter, [68] approaching the forest, from which the reversing reached the reimbursable of the reimbursed is about to jump out, turns all with his horse and raised arapnik into one frozen moment, into gunpowder, to which Here they will bring fire. He dug in the cloudy air in the muddy air and will overtake the beast, he is already reinforcing him with the unstressing, no matter how the whole spinning snow steppe, letting silver stars in his mouth, mustache, in his eyes, eyebrows and his beaver hat.

“Dead souls ...” said a pleasant lady in every way.

- I'm sorry, what? - grabbed the guest, all in excitement.

- Dead Souls!..

- Ah, say, for God!

- This is simply invented only for covering, but the thing is: he wants to take the governor's daughter.

This conclusion, for sure, was unexpectedly and unusually in all respects. A pleasant lady, having heard this, was petrified on the spot, turned pale, turned pale as death and, if, rumbled in earnest.

- Oh my god! She cried out, crumbling with her hands, - I could not have assumed this.

“And I admit, as soon as you opened your mouth, I already realized what was the matter,” answered the lady pleasant in every way.

- But what, after that, Anna Grigoryevna, institute education! After all, here is innocence!

- What innocence! I heard her speeches such speeches that, I admit, I will not have a spirit to pronounce them.

- You know, Anna Grigoryevna, because it just tears the heart when you see what immorality has finally reached.

- And men are crazy about her. And for me, so I admit, I do not find anything in it ... It is unbearable manner.

-Ah, my life, Anna Grigoryevna, she is a statue, and at least some expression in the face.

- Ah, how manner is! Ah, how manner is! God, how manner is! I do not know who learned her, but I have not yet seen women in which there were so many producers.

- Darling! She is a statue and pale as death.

- Ah, do not say, Sofya Ivanovna: it is blurred godlessly.

- Ah, what are you, Anna Grigoryevna: she is chalk, chalk, pure chalk.

- Honey, I sat next to her: a blush in a finger with a thickness and falls off like a plaster, in pieces. Mother learned, the coquette herself, and the daughter will still surpass Mother.

-Well, let me, well, put the oath yourself, which one you want, I am ready to lose children, husband, my husband, if she has at least one drop, even a particle, even a shadow of some blush!

- Ah, what are you saying that, Sofya Ivanovna! - said the lady pleasant in all respects and threw up her hands.

- Ah, what the right you are, Anna Grigoryevna! I look at you with amazement! - said a pleasant lady and threw up her hands too.

Yes, it will not seem strange to the reader that both ladies did not agree among themselves in that they saw almost at the same time. There are, for sure, in the world there are many such things that already have the same property: if one lady looks at them, they will come out completely white, and another will look, red, red, like lingonberries.

“Well, here you are still proof that she is pale,” the pleasant lady continued, “I remember how now I am sitting near Manilov and telling him:“ Look how pale she is! ” Right, you need to be so stupid as our men in order to admire it. And our pretty one ... Ah, as he seemed to me nasty! You cannot imagine, Anna Grigoryevna, to what extent he seemed to me nasty.

- Yes, however, there were some ladies who were not indifferent to him.

- I, Anna Grigoryevna? You never can say this, never, never!

- Yes, I'm not talking about you, as if, except for you, nobody.

- Never, never, Anna Grigoryevna! Let me notice that I know myself very well; But are there any other ladies who play the role of inaccessible.

- Excuse me, Sofya Ivanovna! Let me tell you that there have never been such scandalities for me. For who else is others, but not for me, let me notice it to you.

- Why are you offended? After all, there were other ladies, there were even those who first captured a chair at the door to sit closer to him.

Well, after such words, pronounced by a pleasant lady, the storm had to inevitably follow, but, to the great amazement, both ladies suddenly died, and nothing was followed. In all respects, a pleasant lady remembered that the pattern for a fashionable dress was not yet in her hands, and just a pleasant lady realized that she had not yet managed to find out any details about the discovery made by her sincere friend, and therefore the world followed very soon. However, both ladies cannot be said in their nature the need to apply trouble, and in general in their characters there was nothing evil, and so, insensitively, in the conversation a little desire to stab each other was born by itself; Just one of the other from a little pleasure on occasion will put another living word: here, they say, you! On, take, eat! Different kinds are needs for the hearts of both male and female.

“I can’t, however, understand only that,” said just a pleasant lady, “like Chichikov, being a visiting person, could decide on such a brave passage.” It cannot be that there were no participants.

- Do you think there are no them?

“And who would you think, could help him?”

- Well, even a nostril.

- Really nostrough?

- And then? After all, it will become for it. You know, he wanted to sell his own father or, even better, to lose in cards.

- Ah, my God, what interesting news I will learn from you! I could not have assumed that Nozdrev was involved in this story!

- And I always expected.

- As you think, right, what does not happen in the world! Well, was it possible to assume when, remember, Chichikov had just come to our city that he would produce such a strange march in the light? Ah, Anna Grigoryevna, if you knew how I was rinsing! If not for your favor and friendship ... now, for sure, on the edge of the death ... Where? My Masha sees that I am pale as death. “Darling of a lady,” tells me, “you are pale as death.” “Masha, I say, I don’t have to do it now.” So what a case! So the nostril is here, I ask for dutifully!

A pleasant lady really wanted to find out further details about the abduction, that is, in which hour and so on, but she wanted a lot. In all respects, a pleasant lady directly responded with ignorance. She did not know how to lie: assuming something is another matter, but even in this case when the assumption was based on internal conviction; If an internal belief was felt, then she knew how to stand up for herself, and would try some kind of dock, famous for the gift of winning other people's opinions, he would try to compete here, he would see, which means inner conviction.

That both ladies finally resolutely became convinced that they had previously assumed only as one assumption, there was nothing extraordinary about it. Our brothers, smart people, as we call ourselves, acts almost the same, and our scientific reasoning serve as proof. First, the scientist drives up in them with an extraordinary scoundrel, begins timidly, moderately, begins with the most humble request: is it not from there? Isn't it from the corner such a country received a name? Or: Does this document belong to another, later time? Or: Do you need to understand this people under this people? Immediately, they immediately see some ancient writers and only sees some kind of hint or just seemed to him a hint, he gets a lynx and is awake, speaks with ancient writers easily, sets their requests and even responds to them, paying at all about the fact that He began a timid assumption; It already seems to him that he sees this that it is clear - and the reasoning is concluded by the words: “So this is how it was, so what kind of people need to be understood, so what point you need to look at the subject!” Then, in public from the department, - and the newly open truth went for a walk around the world, gaining herself followers and fans.

At a time when both ladies so successfully and wittyly decided such a confusing circumstance, the prosecutor entered the living room with his forever motionless physiognomy, thick eyebrows and a blinking eye. The ladies began to tell him all the events, talked about the purchase of dead souls, about the intention to take the governor’s daughter and confused him completely, so no matter how much he continued to stand in the same place, clap his left eye and beat himself with a handkerchief in the beard, Sweeping tobacco from there, but could not decisively understand anything. So both ladies left him and each went to rebel the city in their direction. This company managed to produce them with a small half an hour. The city was resolutely rebuilt; Everything came to fermentation, and if only someone could understand anything. The ladies knew how to let such a fog into the eyes of everything that everything, and especially the officials, had a little time remained stunned. Their position in the first minute was like the position of a schoolboy, who, who rushed a sleepy, stuck a hussar in his nose, that is, a piece of paper filled with tobacco. Pulling all tobacco to himself with all the zeal of the sleeping man, he awakens, jumps up, looks like a fool, bulging his eyes, in all directions, and cannot understand where he was, and then he distinguishes the walls illuminated by the indirect ray of the sun , the laughter of the comrades hiding in the corners, and looking out the window on the window, with the awakened forest, sounding thousands of bird voices, and with illuminating the river, there and there the disappearing shocking crumbs between the thin reeds, all updated with naked children, inviting the bathing, and then Already finally feels that a hussar is sitting in his nose. This was completely in the first minute the situation of the inhabitants and officials of the city. Everyone, like a ram, stopped, bulging his eyes. Dead souls, the governor's daughter and Chichikov lost and mixed in their heads unusually strange; And then, after the first stupidity, they seemed to be distinguished by their separates and separate one from the other, began to demand a report and be angry, seeing that the case did not want to explain themselves. What a parable, in fact, what kind of parable of these dead souls? There is no logic in dead souls; How to buy dead souls? Where will the fool take such a fool? And what blind money will he buy it? And at what end, to what case can these dead souls can be pawned? And why did the governor's daughter intervene here? If he wanted to take her away, so why buy dead souls for this? If you buy dead souls, so why take the governor's daughter? To give, or something, did he want her these dead souls? What nonsense, in fact, was smashed around the city? What is the direction that you don’t have time to turn, and then they will release the story, and at least there was any sense ... However, they smashed it, therefore, there was any reason? What is the reason in dead souls? There is not even a reason. It turns out simply: Andrones go, [70] nonsense, Beliberda, soft boots! It’s just a damn thing! .. In a word, the rumor went, and the whole city spoke about the dead souls and the governor’s daughter, about Chichikov and Dead Souls, about the governor's daughter and Chichikov, and everything that is, rose. How Wihor shot up until the city, it seemed a dozing the city! All the Turks and baibaki crawled out of the holes, who were ramping in robes for several years at home, blaming the shoemaker who sewed narrow boots, then on the tailor, then on the boker's drunkard. All those who have long ceased all kinds of acquaintances and knew only as they put it, with the landlords of Zavalishin and Polezhaev (the famous terms produced from the verbs “lie down” and “flood”, which are in great move in Russia, still like a phrase: to call to Sopikov and Khrapovitsky, meaning all sorts of dead dreams on the side, on the back and in all other positions, with backbone, nasal whistles and other accessories); All those who could not be lured out of the house even by the invocation of a five -hundred -piece ear with two -haired sterlets and all sorts of kulebyaki melting in the mouth; In a word, it turned out that the city is both people, and great, and was inhabited as it should. It seemed to some Sysoi Pafntievich and McDonald Karlovich, which were never heard of; In the living rooms, some long, long, with a shot hand, such a tall, which was not even seen, was not even seen. On the streets were covered tremors, unknown rulers, rattles, wheelchairwoods - and porridge was brewed. At other times and under other circumstances, such rumors, perhaps, would not have attracted any attention; But the city of N. has not received any news for a long time. Not even for three months, nothing that is called in the capitals of comer, [71], which, as you know, for the city is the same as the timely supply of food supplies. Suddenly two completely opposite opinions turned out to be in the city interpretation and suddenly two opposite parties were formed: male and female. The male party, the most stupid, drew attention to dead souls. The female took up exclusively by the abduction of the governor's daughter. In this party, it should be noted to the honor of the ladies, it was incomparably more than order and examination. Such, apparently, is the very appointment of them to be good housewives and managers. All of them soon took a living certain appearance, clothed in clear and obvious forms, explained, cleared, in a word, a finished picture came out. It turned out that Chichikov was already in love for a long time, and they saw each other in the garden in the lunar light, that the governor would even give his daughter for him, because Chichikov was rich, like a Jew, if there was no reason for his wife, whom he left (where they learned from where they learned that Chichikov was married, it was not known to anyone), and that the wife, who suffers from hopeless love, wrote a letter to the governor the most touching, and that Chichikov, seeing that his father and mother would never agree, decided to abduct. In other houses, this was told a little differently: that Chichikov did not have any wife at all, but that he, like a thin and acting person for sure, undertook to get a job with his mother and had a heartfelt connection with her, and that Then he made a declaration about the hand of his daughter; But the mother, frightened, so that the crime is not committed, contrary to religion, and feeling in the soul a remorse, refused flatly, and that is why Chichikov decided to abduct. Many explanations and amendments joined all this as rumors finally penetrated the most dull alleys. In Rus', the lower society is very fond of talking about gossip who are in the highest societies, and therefore began to talk about all this in such houses, where Chichikov did not even see and did not know, and even greater explanations went. The plot became more entertaining, took more final forms every day, and finally, since there was, in all its finally, it was delivered to the Governor's own ears. The governor, as the mother of the family, as the first in the city of a lady, finally as a lady who did not suspect anything like it, was completely offended by such stories and came into indignation, fair in all respects. The poor blonde withstood the most unpleasant tête-a-tête, [72] which only ever happened to have a sixteen-year-old girl. The whole streams of questioning, interrogations, reprimands, threats, reproaches, exhortations were poured, so that the girl rushed into tears, sobbed and could not understand a single word; The Swiss was given the strictest order not to accept at any time and under any kind of Chichikov.

Having done their job regarding the governor, the ladies were inhabited by the male party, trying to persuade them to their side and claiming that the dead souls were fiction and was used only to distract all suspicion and more successfully producing the abduction. Many of the men were seduced and pestered to their party, despite the fact that they were subjected to strong complaints from their comrades, who scolded them with women and skirts - names, as you know, very offensive to the male sex.

But no matter how the men were armed and opposed, and in their party there was no such order at all as in the female. They all had a callousness, uncontrolled, wrongly, unshakable, unclean, bad, in the head of Kuter, a hustle and bustle, confusion, untidiness in thoughts-in a word, and the empty nature of a man was recognized in everything, the nature is rude, heavy, not capable of neither house -building, nor cordial beliefs, a nucleant, lazy, full of continuous doubts and eternal fear. They said that all this is nonsense, that the abduction of the governor’s daughter is more hussar than civilian, that Chichikov would not do this, that the woman is lying, that the woman is a bag: what they put, it carries, that the main object that needs to be paid attention to, There are dead souls, which, however, the devil knows what they mean, but they contain, however, very bad, bad. Why did it seem to men that they consisted of bad and bad, we will find out this moment: a new governor general was appointed to the province-an event, as you know, leading officials to anxious state: there will be overdoor, swelling, excesses and all sorts of official stews that the chief treats. their subordinates. “Well,” the officials thought, “if he only finds out that in the city they are about what stupid rumors, and for this one can boil not for life, but for death.” The inspector of the medical council suddenly turned pale; He introduced him to God knows that: whether the patients who died in a significant quantity in lasaretes and in other places from the rampant fever, against whom were not taken, were not taken under the word “dead souls”, and that Chichikov is not a sent official from the office of the general -Governor for the work of a secret investigation. He reported this to the chairman. The chairman replied that it was nonsense, and then suddenly turned pale, asking himself the question, but what if the souls bought by Chichikov are really dead? And he allowed to make a fortress on them and even played the role of Plyushkin’s attorney, and this will reach the attention of the Governor General, then what? He is nothing more about this, as soon as he said to one and the other, and suddenly one and the other turned pale; Fear is more sticky than plague and is reported instantly. Everyone suddenly found in themselves the sins that were not even. The word "dead souls" was so vague that they even suspected whether there was a hint of suddenly buried bodies, due to two not so long -long events. The first event was with some soil merchants who came to the city at the fair and crushed the Friends of their Ustsysol merchants, a pier on the Russian gender with German ventures: arshads, punch, balms, etc. The feast, as usual, ended in a fight. The Solvychegodsky left the Ustsysolsky to death, although they carried a strong abstract on their sides, under the mikitka and to the sun -enchanting, testifying to the exorbitant size of the fists that the dead were equipped with. One of the triumphed even had a nasos knocked down, in the words of the fighters, that is, the whole nose was smashed, so that there was no left on his face and half a half. In their case, the merchants obeyed, explaining that they were playing a little; rumors were rushed that, with a guilty head, they put four state each; However, the matter is too dark; It turned out from the undertaken bearing and consequences that the Ustsysol guys died from the Ugar, and therefore they were buried as the slandered. Another incident, recently what happened, was the following: the official peasants of the village of Sting-Sente, connecting with the same peasants of the village of Borovka, Zadirailovo-Log, demolished the zemstvo police from the face of the Earth in the person of the meeting, some kind of Zapobyazhkin, as if to the Zemstvo police, That is, the assessor of Krobyazhkin, got into a lot of often traveling to their village, that in other cases there is a rampant fever, and the reason is the one that the Zemstvo police, having some weaknesses from the cardiac side, looked at women and village girls. Probably, however, it is not known, although the peasants expressed himself directly in the testimony that the Zemstvo police were a prodigal, like a cat, and that more than once they protected him and once even drove naked from some hut where he had climbed. Of course, the Zemstvo police were worthy of punishment for heartfelt weaknesses, but the peasants, both lousy-pass, and Zadirailov, could also not be justified for arbitrariness if they only really participated in killing. But the matter was dark, the zemstvo police were found on the road, a uniform or a grave at the zemstvo police was worse than a rag, and even physiognomy could not be recognized. The case went around the courts and finally entered the ward, where it was first reasoned in the same sense: since it is not known which of the peasants participated, and all of them are a lot of them, but the man is dead, therefore, he was a little in the priest Even he won the case, and the men were still alive, therefore, the decision in their favor is very important for them; It was decided as a result of this: that the assessor of Dzbybazhkin was the reason, providing unjust oppression to the peasants of lord-passage and Zadirailov, and he died, returning to the sleigh, from an apoplectic blow. The case, it would seem, was turned up, but officials, it was not known why, began to think that, rightly, the case is now about these dead souls. It happened that, as it was on purpose, at a time when the gentlemen were already in a difficult situation, two papers came to the governor at once. One of them contained that, according to the reached testimony and reports, in their province, the makeer of the false banknotes, hiding under different names, and so that the strictest search was immediately committed. Another paper contained the attitude of the governor of a neighboring province about the robber who fades from legitimate persecution, and that what a suspicious person would be in their province, which does not show any evidence and arable ports, then detain him immediately. These two papers stunned everyone. The previous conclusions and guesses were completely confused. Of course, it was impossible to assume that something to Chichikov belonged here; However, everyone, as everyone was reflected for their part, was reminded that they still do not know who Chichikov really was, that he himself spoke very unclear about his own face, said, however, that he suffered in the service for the truth, yes After all, all this is somehow unclear, and when they remembered that he even put it, as if he had many enemies who had eaten his life, they thought even more: therefore, his life was in danger, therefore, he was persecuted, he became Be, he did something like that ... but who is he really like that? Of course, you can’t think that he can make fake papers, and even more so to be a robber: the appearance is reliable; But for all that, who would, however, was he really? And the gentlemen, officials now asked themselves a question that they had to ask themselves at the beginning, that is, in the first chapter of our poem. It was decided to make several questions to those who had bought the souls, at least to find out what kind of purchases, and what exactly should be understood under these dead souls, and did he not explain to anyone, though, by chance, by chance, by passing. Though casually somehow his real intentions, and whether he told someone about who he was. First of all, they reacted to the box, but they didn’t get a lot: I bought it for fifteen rubles, and the bird feathers also buy, and promised to buy a lot, he also put the lard in the treasury, and therefore, probably, a rogue, because there was already one such, because there was one such, because there was only one. who bought bird feathers and supplied the lard to the treasury, but he deceived everyone and the protopopsu puffed up more than a hundred rubles. Everything that she said further was the repetition of almost the same thing, and the officials only saw that the box was just a stupid old woman. Manilov replied that for Pavel Ivanovich he was always ready to vouch for himself, that he would sacrifice his whole estate in order to have a hundredth share of the qualities of Pavel Ivanovich, and responded about him in general in the most flattering expressions, adding a few thoughts about friendship already from closed eyes. These thoughts, of course, satisfactorily explained the tender movement of his heart, but did not explain to the officials of the present business. Sobakevich replied that Chichikov, in his opinion, was good, and that he sold him to choose from the peasants and the people in all respects are alive; But that he does not vouch for what will happen forward, that if they laugh during the difficulties of resettlement on the road, then not his fault, and that God is in power, but there are a lot of hot and various deadly diseases in the world, and there are examples that Entire villages are dying out. Gentlemen, officials resorted to another tool, not very noble, but which, however, is sometimes used, that is, by the side, through different lackey dating, to ask Chichikov’s people, if they know what details about the former life and circumstances of the master, but they also heard A little. From Parsley they heard only the smell of residential peace, and from Selifan, which he completed the state service and served before customs, and nothing more. This class of people has a very strange custom. If you ask him directly about something, he will never remember, he will not take everything in his head and even just answer that he does not know, and if he ask what else, he will fall into him and tell with the details that are of the details that And you don't want to know. All searches made by officials opened only the fact that they probably did not know what Chichikov is, but what, however, Chichikov should be something. They finally put it to talk completely about this subject and decide, at least what to do and what measures to take, and what is he: is it such a person who needs to be detained and grasped as unreliable, or is he such a person who can grab it himself and detain them all as unreliable. For all this, it was supposed to gather on purpose from the police chief, already known to readers of the father and benefactor of the city.

The chapter is tenth

Having gathered at the police officer, already known to the readers of the father and benefactor of the city, officials had the opportunity to notice each other that they even lost weight from these worries and anxieties. In fact, the appointment of a new governor-general, and these obtained papers of such a suerial content, and these God knows what rumors-all this left noticeable traces in their faces, and the tailcoat on many became noticeably more spacious. Everything was given: the chairman lost weight, and the inspector of the medical council lost weight, and the prosecutor lost weight, and some Semyon Ivanovich, who never called the name, which was on the index finger of the ring, which gave the ladies to consider, even he lost weight. Of course, there were, as it happens everywhere, some are a non-ribbed dozen who did not lose the presence of the spirit, but there were very few of them. The postmaster is only. He alone did not change in a constantly even character and always in such cases had the usual to say: “We know you, Governor General! You may change three or four, but I’ve been for thirty years, my judo, I’ve been sitting in one place. ” Other officials usually remarked to this: “It is good for you, Shprahen Zech Andreich, you have a postal case: accept and send an expedition; Unless you puff out, locked the presence an hour earlier, and you will take from the late merchant to receive a letter at the wrong time or you will go through a different parcel that should not be sent - here, of course, everyone will be a saint. But let the features be done to you every day by the arm, so you don’t want to take it, but he himself sticks. Of course, you have a spray, you have one little son, and here, brother, Praskovya Fedorovna endowed God with such grace that a year, then carries: either Praskushka or Petrush; Here, brother, you’ll sing something else. ” So the officials said, but whether it is possible to resist the devil, not to judge this. In this time, the absence of the necessary thing, which in common people is called really, was very noticeable. In general, we somehow were not created for representative meetings. In all our meetings, from peasant worldly gathering to all possible scientists and other committees, if there is no one chapter that runs everything, there is a scary confusion. It's hard to even say why it is; It can be seen that such people are already, only those meetings that are compiled in order to buy or have lunch, like: clubs and all kinds of vinsals [73] on the German leg. And there is, perhaps, for everything, for all a minute. Suddenly, like the wind will play, we will have charity, encouraging societies and what. The goal will be beautiful, but with all that nothing will come out. Maybe this happens because we are suddenly satisfied at the very beginning and already read that everything is done. For example, having started some charity society for the poor and sacrificing significant amounts, we immediately set dinner to all the first dignitaries of the city to commemorate such a laudable act by half of all donated amounts; An excellent apartment is hired by the rest for the Committee, with heating and watchmen, and then the entire amount remains for the poor five rubles with half a year, and here in the distribution of this amount, not all members agree between themselves, and everyone sticks some of their own kuma. However, the meeting that now gathered was a completely different kind: it was formed as a result of necessity. It was not about any poor or outsiders that the case concerned all officials personally, the matter concerned trouble, who equally threatened everyone; Therefore, involuntarily, it should be more unanimous, closer. But with all that the devil came out, knows what it is. Not to mention the disagreements inherent in all the advice, in the opinion of the audience, some even incomprehensible indecision was discovered: one said that Chichikov made a state of state banknotes, and then he himself added: “And maybe not the case”; Another claimed that he was an official of the Governor-General Chancellery, and immediately added: “But by the way, the devil knows, you won’t read it on his forehead.” Against the hunch, whether the robber was disguised, everyone armed; They found that in excess of appearance, which was already reliable in itself, in his conversations there was nothing that would show a person with violent acts. Suddenly, the postmaster, who remained for several minutes immersed in some thought, due to the sudden inspiration that dawned on him, or something else, screamed unexpectedly:

- You know, gentlemen, who is it?

The voice with which he said this made something amazing in himself, so he made everyone cry out at the same time:

- Who?

- This, gentlemen, is my judgment, not someone else, like Captain Kopeikin!

And when everyone was immediately asked unanimously: "Who is this captain Kopeikin?" - The postmaster said:

“So you don’t know who Captain Kopeikin is?”

Everyone answered that they did not know who Captain Kopeikin is.

“Captain Kopeikin,” said the postmaster, who opened his snuffbox only half, out of fear that one of the neighbors would not launch his fingers there, whose purity he poorly believes and even had the usual to say: “We know, father: you are your fingers, with your fingers, with your fingers, with your fingers, with your fingers, with your fingers, with your fingers, Maybe you’re visiting what places you visit, and tobacco is a thing that requires cleanliness. ” “Captain Kopeikin,” said the postmaster, already sniffing tobacco, “but this, however, if you tell, a whole poem is a resonant for some writer.”

All those present expressed a desire to find out this story, or, as the postmaster put it, a resuscitive for the writer in some ways a whole poem, and he began this way:

Tale of Captain Kopeikin

“After the twelfth year’s campaign, you are mine,” the postmaster began, despite the fact that not one sir was sitting in the room, but six of the twelfth year, and Captain Kopeikin was sent along with the wounded. Under the red, or under Leipzig, only you can imagine, he was torn off his hand and leg. Well, then no, you know, such orders; This disabled capital has already been established, you can imagine, in some ways much after. Captain Kopeikin sees: it would be necessary to work, only his hand, you see, is left. I visited my father; Father says: “I have nothing to feed you, I,” you can imagine, “barely get the bread myself.” Here my captain Kopeikin decided to go, my judo, to Petersburg, to ask the sovereign, whether there will be any merciful mercy: “What is, so, so, in some way, so to speak, he sacrificed life, shed blood ...“ Well, ”well,“ Well, ”well,” Once there, you know, with convoys or queens, in a word, my judo, he dragged himself somehow to St. Petersburg. Well, you can imagine: a kind of some, that is, Captain Kopeikin and suddenly found himself in the capital, which, so to speak, is not in the world! Suddenly, in front of him, the light, so to speak, is a certain field of life, a fabulous Shekherzada. Suddenly some kind of kind, you can imagine, Nevsky Prospekt, or there, you know, some pea, damn it! or there is some kind of foundry; There, Spitz is like some kind of air in the air; The bridges there hang a kind of feature, you can imagine, without any, that is, touching, in a word, Semiramida, the Sudden, and fully! I hired apartments, only all this bites terribly: curtains, curtains, drawing such, you see, carpets - Persia whole; With your foot, so to speak, you are trampling the capital. Well, just, that is, you go down the street, and your nose is so hearing that it smells of thousands; And my captain Kopeikin, you see, consists of some ten blue. Well, somehow there was a shelter in the Revel's tavern per ruble per day; Lunch - cabbage soup, a piece of beaten beef. He sees: there is nothing to clarify. He asked where to go. They say that there is, in some ways, the highest commission, the right, you see, a kind, and the chief of General-Anthef [74] is such and such. And the sovereign, you need to know, at that time was not in the capital; The troops, you can imagine, have not yet returned from Paris, everything was abroad. My Kopeikin, who got up with a stern, scratched his beard with his left hand, because paying the barber - it will be, in some way, the count, he prayed the uniform and on his wood, you can imagine, went to the boss himself, to the nobleman. I asked the apartment. “There,” they say, indicating him the house on the palace embankment. You, you see, a man’s hut: glasses in the windows, you can imagine one and a half driven mirrors, so that the vases and everything that is in the rooms seem to be in the rooms - could, in some way, get a hand from the street; Precious Marmores on the walls, metal galangter, some handle at the door, so you need to run away in a petty shop, but buy soap on a penny, but you will decide to grab their hands for two hours, and then you will decide to grab it for it,-- In a word: varnishes on everything are such - in some way the mind is dull. One Switzer is already looking at the generalissimo: the gilded mace, the count physiognomy, as a fattened fat pug; Batista collars, cloths! .. My kopeikin got up somehow with his wooder into the reception room, pressed there in the corner so as not to push his elbow, you can imagine, some America or India-the gilded, you see, the porcelain vase of the epic. Well, of course, that he insisted there plenty, because, you can imagine, he came even at a time when the general, in some ways, barely got out of bed and a valet, maybe he brought him some silver pelvis for different ones, You see, the washing of such. My kopeikin is waiting for four hours, as finally includes an adjutant or there is another officer on duty. "General, he says, will go to the reception room now." And in the reception of the people - like beans on a plate. All this is not that our brother slave, all the fourth or fifth grade, colonels, and in some places a thick pasta shines on Epipol-a general, in a word, such. Suddenly, in the room, you see, a slightly noticeable bustle flashed, like some thin broadcast. It came there and there: “Shu, Shu,” and finally the silence came terrible. The nobleman enters. Well ... you can imagine: a state man! In the face, so to speak ... well, in accordance with the title, you understand ... with a high rank ... such an expression, you understand. Everything that was in the front, of course, at the same moment in a string, awaits, trembles, waits for decisions, in some way, fate. The minister, or the nobleman, approaches one, to the other: “Why are you? Why do you? What do you want? What is your business? " Finally, my judo, to Kopeikin. Kopeikin, gathered with the spirit: “So and so, your Excellency: shed blood, lost, in some ways, arms and legs, I can’t work, I dare to ask the monarch of mercy.” The minister sees: a man on a piece of wood and the right sleeve empty are fastened to the uniform: "Good, he says, come to the other day." My kopeikin is almost delighted: one thing that was awarded the audience, so to speak, with the first -style nobles; And the other is that now it will finally decide, in some way, about the pension. In the spirit, you see, this is bouncing along the sidewalk. He went into the Palkin tavern to drink a glass of vodka, dined, my trial, in London, ordered to give himself a cutlet with capers, Pullarka asked with various finterners; He asked a bottle of wine, in the EVE went to the theater - in a word, you know, he drunk. On the sidewalk, he sees, there is some kind of slender Englishwoman, like a swan, you can imagine a kind of herself. My kopeikin-the blood, you know, was played out in him-I ran after her on his wood, a trick-trip after-“No, I thought, even if I get a pension, now I was too diverge.” Here, my judgment, some after three to four days is my kopeikin again to the minister, waited for the exit. “So and so, he says, he came, he says, to hear the order of your high -abundance for the obsessed disease and for wounds ...” - and the like, you see, in the official syllable. The nobleman, you can imagine, immediately recognized him: “And, he says, well, he says, this time I can’t tell you anything more, as soon as the Sovereign’s arrival will expect; Then, no doubt, orders about the wounded will be made, and without the monarch, so to speak, I can’t do anything. ” Black, you understand, and - goodbye. Kopeikin, you can imagine, went out in the position of the most uncertain. He already thought that tomorrow they would give him money: “On you, my dear, drink, and have fun”; And instead he was ordered to wait, and time is not set. So he left such an owl from the porch as a poodle, you understand, which the cook doused with water: both his tail between his legs, and hung his ears. “Well, no,” he thinks to himself, “I’ll go another time, I will explain that I’m eating the last piece,“ I won’t help, I have to die, in some ways, from hunger. ” In a word, he comes, my judo, again to the palace embankment; They say: "You can’t, do not accept, come tomorrow." The next day is the same; And the Swiss simply does not want to look at him. Meanwhile, he has only one from Sinyukh, only one remains in his pocket. That, it happened, the cabbage, beef, a piece of beef, and now in a bench there will take some herring or a cucumber of salty and bread for two pennies-in a word, the poor man is starving, and meanwhile, the appetite is simply wolf. There is a kind of restaurant-a cook there, you can imagine a foreigner, a Frenchman, a fan with an open physiognomy, a Dutch linen on it, an apron, with a whiteness equal to the snow, there is a fenzer [75] some cutlets with truffles, a word , a random-dedicest is such that he would just ate himself from his appetite. Whether there will pass by the Milyutinsky shops, there, in some way, the salmon of the kind of cherries peeps out of the window-five rubles a piece, a watermelon-gromadische, a diligijans as a kind, leaned out of the window and, so to speak, looking for a fool who would pay a hundred rubles,-- In a word, at every step, such a temptation, drooling flow, but he hears, meanwhile, everything is “tomorrow”. So you can imagine what his position is: here, on the one hand,, so to speak, the salmon and watermelon, and on the other hand, they bring him the same dish: "Tomorrow." Finally, the poor fellow, in some way, was unbearable, decided at all costs to crawl with a storm, you see. He waited at the entrance, whether there would be any other petitioner, and there with some general, you see, slipped with his wooder into the reception room. The nobleman, as usual, turns out: “Why are you? Why do you? A! - He says, seeing Kopyikin, - because I have already announced to you that you should expect decisions. " - “Have mercy, your excessiveness, I have no, so to speak, a piece of bread ...” - “What to do? I can't do anything for you; Try to so far help yourself, look for your own means. ” - “But, your high -abundance, you yourself can, in some ways, judge what means I can find without having a hand or a leg.” “But,” says the dignitary, “agree: I cannot support you, in some way, at my own expense; I have a lot of wounded, they all have an equal right ... Armed with patience. The sovereign will come, I can give you honestly that his monarchy mercy will not leave you. " “But, your excessiveness, I can’t wait,” says Kopeikin, and says, in some respect, rude. The nobleman, you see, has already become annoying. In fact: here, from all sides, generals expect decisions, orders; Things, so to speak, are important, state -owned, requiring self -sophisticated performance - a minute of omission can be important - and then an inevitable feature has become attached to the side. “Sorry, he says, I have no time ... Things are waiting for me more important than yours.” It resembles in a way, in a way, thin, that it's time to finally go out. And my kopeikin,-hunger, you know, spurred him: “As you want, your excessiveness, he says, will not come from a place until you give a resolution.” Well ... you can imagine: in this way, the nobleman who is only a word is - so the racers flew up, so that the devil will not find you ... Here, if our brother says, a smaller rank, like that, so rudeness. Well, and there is the size, the size is: the general-general and some captain Kopeikin! Ninety rubles and zero! The general, you see, is nothing more as soon as he looked, and his gaze is a firearm: there is no soul - she went into heels. And my kopeikin, you can imagine, not from a place, stands like a dug. "What are you?" - says the general and accepted it, as they say, in the shoulder blades. However, to tell the truth, he was still quite gracious: he would have frightened other things so that for three days he would have spinned upside down, and he only said: “Well, he says if you are expensive to live here and you cannot stay in the capital as well Decisions of your fate, so I will send you to the state account. Call the courier! Pass it to the place of residence! " And you, you know, is worth it there: you can imagine a three-hand peasant, you can imagine, the most in kind is arranged for coachmen-in a word, a dentist like a kind ... Here is his, the servant of God, grabbed my judgment, but in a cart, a trolley. With a courier. “Well,” Kopeikin thinks, “at least you don’t have to pay groomers, thanks for that.” Here he is, my judgment, goes to the Feldyeger, yes, go to the Feldyeger, in some way, so to speak, argues to himself: “When the general says that I will look for the means to help myself, - well, I say, I will find facilities!" Well, as soon as he was taken to his place and where exactly they brought him, nothing of this is unknown. So, you see, the rumors of Captain Kopeikin sunk into the River of oblivion, into some kind of summer, as the poets call. But, let me, gentlemen, this is where it begins, one might say, a thread, a tie of the novel. So, where Kopeikin went is unknown; But it didn’t have passed, you can imagine, two months, as a gang of robbers appeared in the Ryazan forests, and the chieftain was this gang, my judgment, not someone else ... ”

“Just let it be, Ivan Andreevich,” said the police officer suddenly, interrupting him, “because Captain Kopeikin, you yourself said, without arms and legs, and Chichikov’s ...

Here, the postmaster cried out and slapped from the whole scale with his hand on his forehead, calling himself publicly at all the calf. He could not understand how such a circumstance did not come to him at the very beginning of the story, and admitted that the saying was completely fair: "The Russian man with his back mind is strong." However, a minute later he immediately began to cunning and tried to get out, saying that, however, the mechanic was very advanced in England, which can be seen in the newspapers, as one invented wooden legs in such a way that, with one touch, these legs of a person carried away these legs of a person God knows in which places, so after nowhere it was impossible to find him.

But everyone doubted that Chichikov was Captain Kopeikin, and found that the postmaster had enough too far. However, they, for their part, also did not hit the mud and, pointed by the witty guess of the postmaster, wandered almost further. Of the many of the kind of visible assumptions, there was finally one thing - it is strange even to say: that is not Chichikov, disguised Napoleon, that the Englishman has long been jealous that, they say, Russia is so great and extensive that there were even caricatures several times, where the Russian It is depicted talking to the Englishman. The Englishman stands and holds a dog on a rope behind, and Napoleon is, of course, under the dog: “Look, they say, he says, if not so, I will let this dog out on you now!” - And now they, perhaps, let him out of Elena’s island, and now he is making his way to Russia, as if Chichikov, but really not Chichikov at all.

Of course, the officials did not believe this, but, by the way, they thought and, considering this business to himself, found that Chichikov’s face, if he turns and gets sideways, is very handed over to the portrait of Napoleon. The police officer, who served in the twelfth year’s campaign and personally saw Napoleon, could not help but confess that he would not be taller than Chichikov and that Napoleon’s warehouse could not be said too thick, but not so thin. Maybe some readers will call all this incredible; The author, too, for the sake of them, would be ready to call all this incredible; But, as trouble, everything happened as it is told, and even more amazing that the city was not in the wilderness, but, on the contrary, not far from both capitals. However, it must be remembered that all this happened shortly after the ladder exile of the French. At this time, all our landowners, officials, merchants, sidelts and any competent and even illiterate people became at least for the whole eight years with sworn politicians. “Moscow Vedomosti” and “Son of the Fatherland” were read out mercilessly and reached the last reader in pieces, not suitable for any use. Instead of questions: “How much, priest, sold the measure of oats? How did you use yesterday's powder? " - They said: "What are they written in the newspapers, did Napoleon out of the island again released?" The merchants were very afraid of this, for they completely believed the prediction of one prophet, who had been sitting in the prison for three years; The Prophet came from where in the bast shoes and a nagal sheepskin coat, terribly responding with rotten fish, and announced that Napoleon was an antichrist and was holding on a stone chain, behind six walls and seven seas, but after tearing the chain and master the whole world. The Prophet for the prediction fell, as it should, in the prison, but nevertheless did his job and confused completely merchants. For a long time, during even the most profitable transactions, merchants, going to the tavern to drink them with tea, talked about the Antichrist. Many of the officials and the noble nobility also involuntarily thought about it and, infected with mysticism, which, as you know, was then in great fashion, saw in every letter that was composed of the word “Napoleon”, some special meaning; Many even discovered apocalyptic numbers in it. [76] So, there is nothing surprising that officials involuntarily thought at this point; Soon, however, they realized, noting that their imagination is already too trot and that all this is not right. They thought, thought, interpreted, interpreted and finally decided that it would not be bad to ask a good nostrough. Since he first made a story about dead souls and was, as they say, in some close relations with Chichikov, therefore, without a doubt, he knows some of the circumstances of his life, then try more that Nostrev will say.

Strange people these gentlemen are officials, and behind them all the other titles: after all, they knew very well that the nostril liar, that he could not believe in any word or in the trinket itself, and meanwhile, it was resorted to him. Go sweet with a person! does not believe in God, but believes that if a port is scratched, he will certainly die; It will miss the creation of a poet, clear as a day, everything imbued with consent and high wisdom of simplicity, and will rush precisely on where some strangler will confuse, fall in, breaks, twist nature, and he will like it, and he will shout: “Here it is , this is the real knowledge of the secrets of the heart! " All his life does not put the doctors in a penny, but will end with the fact that he will finally turn to a woman who heals with whispering and craps, or, even better, he will think of some kind of decoration from the same rubbish, which, God knows why, will imagine him precisely a means Against his illness. Of course, one can partially apologize to the gentlemen of the officials with a really difficult situation. The drowning man, they say, clutches for a small sliver, and he does not have reason at that time to think that on a chip, can he ride a fly, and there are almost four pounds in it, if not even five; But at that time the consideration does not come to him, and he grabs the sliver. So our gentlemen finally seized on Nosdrev. The police officer at the same moment wrote a note to him for the evening, and the quarterly, in the boots, with an attractive blush on his cheeks, ran at the same moment, holding his sword, in the point of Nozdrevrev’s apartment. Nozdrev was busy with an important business; For four days he no longer left the room, did not let anyone in and received lunch in the window - in a word, even emaciated and greeted. The case required great attentiveness: it consisted of selecting from several dozen downs of cards of one waist, but the most mark on which could be hidden, as if on a faithful friend. The work remained, at least for two weeks; In all the continuation of this time, Porfiry was to clean the Medhelian puppy the navel with a special brush and wash it three times a day in the soap. Nozdrev was very angry for disturbing his solitude; First of all, he sent a quarterly to hell, but when he read the city man in a note, what could happen, because some beginner was waiting for the evening, softened at the same moment, locked the room hastily, dressed as it came and went to them. The testimonies, evidence and assumptions of Nozdrev presented such a sharp opposite of the same gentlemen of the officials that their last guesses were confused. He was decisively a person for whom there was no doubt at all; And how much sratability and timidity in assumptions were noticeable, so much firmness and confidence. He answered all points without even stuttering, announced that Chichikov bought dead souls for several thousand and that he himself sold him because he did not see the reason why he could not sell; When asked if he was not trying to explore something, Nosdrev replied that the spy, that was at school, where he studied with him, he was called fiscal, and that for this comrades, including him , somewhat a few of him, so then it was necessary to put two hundred and forty drinks to one temples-that is, he wanted to say forty, but two hundred affected somehow by itself. When asked if he was doing fake pieces of paper, he replied that the makeer, and at the same time, told the joke about the unusual dexterity of Chichikov: how, having learned that in his house there were two million fake banknotes, they sealed the house and put a guard on him, on Each door is two soldiers, and as Chichikov changed them all one night, so the next day, when they removed the seals, they saw that all the banknotes were real. When asked whether Chichikov had the intention to take the governor’s daughter and whether he himself undertook to help and participate in this matter, Noshodes answered that he helped and that if not for him, he would not work out, he would be realized here , seeing that he lied in vain in vain and could thus get trouble on himself, but he could no longer hold the tongue. However, it was difficult, because such interesting details were introduced by themselves, which could not be abandoned: it was even named by the name of the village, where the parish church, which was supposed to get married, was the village of Trukhmachevka, pop - father Sidor, Pop, Sidor. For the wedding - seventy -five rubles, and then he would not agree if he had not scared him, promising to convey to him that he transferred Mikhail’s labazer on Kum that he even lost his stroller and prepared at all stations of variable horses. Details came to the point that he was already beginning to be called by names of coachmen. They tried to hint of Napoleon, but they themselves were not happy that they tried, because Nozdrev suffered such a non -western that not only had no semblance of truth, but even just had no likeness, so the officials, sighed, all went away away; Only the police officer was listening for a long time, thinking, would it not, at least, at least, but finally waved his hand, saying: “The devil knows what it is!” And everyone agreed that no matter how to fight with a bull, and all milk could not be achieved. And the officials remained in the worst position than before, and it was decided that they could not find out what Chichikov was. And it turned out to be clear what kind of creation is a person: wise, smart and a sense he is in everything that concerns others, and not himself; What careful, firm tips he will supply in difficult cases of life! “A h from a quick head! The crowd shouts. - What an unshakable character! ” And we are doing this brilliant head for some trouble and let him be set to him in difficult occasions, Kuda had a character, an unshakable husband was at a loss, and a miserable coward, an insignificant, weak child, or just Fetyuk, as Nozdrev calls, came out of him.

All these rumors, opinions and rumors, it is not known for what reason, most of all affected the poor prosecutor. They acted on him to such an extent that he, having come home, began to think, think, and suddenly, as they say, died from either the other. Lee or what others grabbed him, only he was sitting as he was sitting and slammed from his chair. They cried out, as usual, with their hands with their hands: "Oh, my God!" - They sent for a doctor to let blood, but saw that the prosecutor was already one soulless body. Then only with condolences they learned that the deceased had, for sure, a soul, although he never showed her out of his modesty. Meanwhile, the appearance of death was as terrible in the small man, as it was terrible in the great man: the one who went not so long ago, moved, played the whist, signed different papers and was so often visible between officials with his thick eyebrows and A blinking eye, now lay on the table, the left eye no longer blinked at all, but an eyebrow was still raised with some kind of interrogative expression. What the deceased asked why he died or why he lived, God is in charge of this.

But this, however, is inconsistent! This is inconsistent with nothing! This is impossible so that officials can scare themselves like that; Create such nonsense, so move away from the truth, when even the child shows what is the matter! So many readers will say and will reproach the author in inconsistencies or call poor officials fools, because a person is generous with the word “fool” and is ready to serve them twenty times a day for his neighbor. It’s enough of ten sides to have one stupid to be a fool past nine good. It is easy for readers to judge, looking from their late corner and top, from where the entire horizon is open to everything that is done below, where only a close object is visible to a person. And in the World Chronicle of mankind there are many centuries that, it would seem, crossed out and destroyed as unnecessary. A lot of misconceptions took place in the world, which, it seemed, would now not have done a child. What a curved, deaf, narrow, impenetrable, bringing far towards the road was elected humanity, trying to achieve eternal truth, while a direct path was opened in front of him, a similar path leading to a magnificent temple, appointed to the king in the Halls! It is wider and luxurious all the other ways, illuminated by the sun and lit all night with lights, but people flowed past it in deaf darkness. And how many times already visited from heaven, they knew how to recoil and go aside, they knew how to get into impenetrable outbacks in broad daylight, they knew how to let each other's eyes again and, sighing after swamp lights, knew how to get it. Get to the abyss, then to ask each other with horror: where is the way out, where is the road? Now he sees everything clearly of the current generation, marks the misconceptions, laughs at the unreasonable of his ancestors, not in vain, that this chronicle is dyed with heavenly fire, that every letter screams in it, that a piercing ring on him, on the current generation, is in his deadly resting; But the current generation laughs and arrogantly, proudly begins a number of new errors, which the descendants will also laugh at later.

Chichikov did not know anything about all this. As it was on purpose, at that time he received a slight cold - a flux and a slight inflammation in the throat, in the distribution of which the climate of many of our provincial cities is extremely generous. In order not to stop, God save, somehow life without descendants, he decided to better sit for three days in the room. Over the continuation of these days, he rinsed incessantly throat with milk with a fig, which he then ate, and wore a pillow of chamomile and campara tied to his cheek. Wanting to take time with something, he made several new and detailed lists to all the beneficial peasants, he even read some Tom Duchess Lavalier, [77] found in the suitcase, reviewed the various objects and notes in the casket, and in the rest of the one and in Another time, and all this bored with him strongly. He couldn’t understand that it meant that none of the city officials would come to him at least once about health, while until recently they stood in front of the hotel of the tremors - either postmaster, then prosecutors, then chairman. He shrugged only his shoulders, walking around the room. Finally, he felt better and was delighted, God knows how, when he saw the opportunity to go out into the fresh air. Without delay, he immediately set to the toilet, unlocked his casket, poured hot water into a glass of hot water, took out a brush and soap and settled down, which, however, had time for a long time, because, having felt his beard with his hand and looked in the mirror, he was already Said: "Ek what went to write forests!" And in fact, forests are not forests, but throughout the cheek and chin poured a rather thick sowing. Having shaved, he set to dress lively and soon, so he almost jumped out of Pantalon. Finally, he was dressed, went to the cologne and, wrapped in warmer, climbed out into the street, having tied his cheek out of precaution. His output, like any recovered man, was definitely festive. Everything that he came across was accepted by the laughing: both the houses and the passing men were quite, however, of which the other, from which the other had already managed to go his brother in the ear. He intended to make the first visit to the governor. The road came to him a lot of any thoughts on mind; The blonde spun in his head, the imagination began to even be slightly naughty, and he himself began to joke a little and laugh at himself. In this spirit, he found himself in front of the governor's entrance. He already began to hastily throw off his overcoat in the hallway, as the Swiss struck him with completely unexpected words:

- Not ordered to accept!

- How, what are you, apparently, did not recognize me? You look good at the face! - Chichikov told him.

“How not to find out, because I don’t see you for the first time,” said the Swiss. -Yes, you are not ordered to let you down, you can do it.

- Here you have! from what? Why?

“Such an order, so, can be seen,” said the Swiss and added to that the word: “Yes”. After which he became completely at ease in front of him, not preserving the affectionate appearance with which he had been in a hurry to remove the overcoat from him. He seemed to think, looking at him: “Ege! If you are chasing you from the porch, so you, apparently, so-so, some kind of shusher! ”

"Unclear!" - Chichikov thought to himself and immediately went to the Chairman of the Chamber, but the Chairman of the Chamber was so embarrassed, seeing him that he could not tie two words, and spoke such rubbish that even to both of them became conscientiously. Leaving him, no matter how Chichikov tried to explain the road and get to what the chairman reasoned and about what his words could relate, but could not understand anything. Then he went to others: to the police officer, to the vice-governor, to the postmaster, but everyone either did not accept him, or accepted him so strangely, such a forceful and incomprehensible conversation was injected, and such a stupid came out that he doubted his health their brain. I tried to go to anyone else to find out, at least, the reason, and did not get any reason. Like a semi -ton, he wandered without a goal around the city, not being able to decide whether he was crazy, whether the officials lost his head, whether all this was done in a dream, or in reality, nonsense was brewing cleaner than sleep. Late already, almost at dusk, he returned to his hotel, from which he came out in such a good mood, and from boredom ordered to give himself tea. In thought and in some senseless reasoning about the oddity of his position, he began to pour tea, when suddenly the door of his room opened and his nostril appeared in an unexpected way.

- Here says the proverb: "For a friend, seven miles are not an outskirts!" He said, taking off his cartuz. - I pass by, I see the light in the window, give me, I think I will come in, rightly, I don’t sleep. A! It’s good that you have tea on the table, I will drink a cup with pleasure: today I have oversholed all sorts of rubbish at dinner, I feel that the fuss begins in my stomach. I order me to fill the phone! Where is your pipe?

“Why, I don’t smoke the tubes,” Chichikov said.

“Empty, as if I do not know that you are a chicken.” Hey! What is it, your name is your person? Hey Vakhramy, listen!

- Yes, not Vakhramy, but Parsley.

- How? Yes, you had Vakhramy before.

- I did not have Vakhramia.

- Yes, for sure, this is with Derebin Vakhramy. Imagine, Derebin what a blessing: his aunt quarreled with his son for married a serf, and now he wrote him all the estate. I think for myself, now if I had a kind of aunt for further! What are you, brother, so moved away from everyone, nowhere to be? Of course, I know that you are sometimes busy with scientific subjects, you like to read (why did Nozdrev concluded that our hero is engaged in scientists and loves to read, we admit, we can’t say in any way, and even less Chichikov). Ah, Brother Chichikov, if you only saw ... That's exactly, there would be food to your satirical mind (why Chichikov had a satirical mind, this is also unknown). Imagine, brother, they played a hill at the merchant Likhachev, that's where the laughter was! The re -prophery, who was with me: “Here, he says, if now Chichikov, it would be for him for sure! ..” (meanwhile, Chichikov did not know any re -reapendev). But admit, brother, because you, right, presented you then to do with me, remember how you played checkers, because I won ... Yes, brother, you just fed me. But I know the devil, I just can’t be angry. The other day with the chairman ... ah, yes! I must tell you that everything is against you in the city; They think that you are making false papers, bored with me, but I was a mountain for you, I told them that I studied with you and knew my father; Well, there’s nothing to say, I leaked a decent bullet for them.

- Am I making fake papers? - Chichikov cried out, rising from his chair.

“Why are you, however, so scared them?” - continued Nozdrev. - The devil knows, they went crazy with fear: they dressed you up in the robbers and spies ... And the prosecutor died with fright, tomorrow there will be a burial. You will not? They, to tell the truth, are afraid of the new governor general, so that something does not work out because of you; And I am about the Governor-General of such an opinion that if he lifts his nose and overwhelms, then he will decisively do nothing with the nobility. The nobility requires cordiality, isn't it? Of course, you can hide to your office and not give a single ball, but what? After all, you will not win anything. But you, however, Chichikov, started a risky business.

- What is the risky business? - Chichikov asked uneasily.

- Yes, take the governor's daughter. I admit, I was waiting for this, by golly, I waited! For the first time, as soon as I saw you together at the ball, well, I think Chichikov, it’s right, it’s not without reason ... However, in vain you made such a choice, I find nothing good in it. And there is one, relative of Bikusov, sisters his daughter, so that is the girl! You can say: a miracle crankshaft!

- What are you, what are you confusing? How to take the governor's daughter, what are you? - said Chichikov, a bulging eye.

- Well, full, brother, Eka is a secretive person! I admit, I came to you with that: please, I am ready to help you. So be it: I will hold the crown of you, the stroller and variables of the horses will be mine, only with the persuasion: you must give me three thousand bent. Need, brother, at least get into it!

In continuation of all the chatter of Nozdrev, Chichikov wiped his eyes several times, wanting to assure if he hears all this in a dream. The maker of the false banknotes, the guess of the governor’s daughter, the death of the prosecutor, who was the cause of the cause, the arrival of the governor general-all this led a decent fright on him. “Well, if it went to that,” he thought in himself, “there’s nothing more to put it on, you need to get out of here as soon as possible.”

He tried to sell Nozdrevrev as soon as possible, called for the same hour of Selifan and ordered him to be prepared at dawn, so that tomorrow at six in the morning to leave the city certainly, so that everything was revised, Brick was smeared and so on and so on. Selifan said: "Listen, Pavel Ivanovich!" - And he stopped, but, a little time at the door, not moving. The master immediately ordered Parsley to put out a suitcase from under the bed, which was already covered with dust, and began to lay with him, without a large parsing, stockings, shirts, linen washed and unwashed, boots, calendar ... All this was laid as it hit; He certainly wanted to be prepared in the evening, so that no delay could happen the next day. Selifan, standing for two minutes at the door, finally very slowly left the room. Slowly, as soon as you can imagine it slowly, he went down from the stairs, imprinting the traces of the battered steps with his wet boots, and for a long time scratched his hand in his back of his head. What did this scratch mean? And what does it mean? Is the annoyance of the fact that the gathering of his brother in an unsightly sheepskin coat, surrounded by a sash, was not successful the next day, somewhere in the tsar’s tavern, or has already started in a new place, what is the ghost of the heart and have to leave the evening standing at the gate and the political holding for Belas The pens at that hour, how are the twilight of Twilight, the kid in the red shirt brings on the balalaika in front of the courtyard and the quiet speeches of a heterogeneous worked out people weave? Or is it just a pity to leave the already heated place in the human cuisine under a sheepskin coat, near the stove, and with a city soft cake, so that it is again to drag in the rain, and slush, and all road hardening? God news, you will not guess. Much of different things mean the Russian people in the back of the head.

The chapter is the eleventh

Nothing, however, happened as Chichikov suggested. Firstly, he woke up later than he thought-this was the first trouble. Getting up, he sent the same hour to find out whether the Brichka was laid and whether everything was ready; But they reported that the Brichka was not yet laid down and nothing was ready. It was a second trouble. He was angry, prepared even to set something like a brawl to a friend to our Selifan and expected only with impatience that he, for his part, would give the reason for excuse. Soon Selifan appeared in the doorway, and the master had the pleasure of hearing the same speeches that are usually heard from the servants in the case when you need to go soon.

- Why, Pavel Ivanovich, you will need to forge horses.

- Oh, you are a chush! Churban! And before why did not say about it? Wasn't there time?

-Yes, there was a time ... Yes, and here is the wheel too, Pavel Ivanovich, the tire will need to be completely pulled, because now the road is a bumpy, Shiben [78] this has gone everywhere ... Yes, if you allow you to report: Brichka was completely shattered, so she was completely shaken, so she was, so that she , perhaps, will not do two stations.

- You are a scoundrel! - Chichikov cried out, crumbling his hands, and came to him so close that Selifan out of fear, so as not to get a gift from the master, backed away a little back and stepped aside. - Are you going to kill me? A? Do you want to slaughter me? On the big road, I was going to slaughter me, the robber, you are a damned chushka, a marine monster! A? A? Three weeks sat still, huh? If only he stuttered, dissolved, - but now at the last hour he drove! When almost on the alert: to sit down and go, huh? And here you were attacking, huh? A? After all, you knew this before? After all, you knew this, huh? A? Answer. Knew? A?

“He knew,” Selifan answered, his head with his head.

“Well, why didn’t I say then, huh?”

Selifan did not answer this question, but, with his head, it seemed to say to himself: “You see how it happened wisely; And he knew, yes, he didn’t say! "

- Now now go to bring the blacksmith, so that in two o’clock everything was done. Do you hear? Be sure to at two o’clock, and if not, then I am you, I ... I’ll bother you and tie it in a hub! - Our hero was very angry.

Selifan turned to the door in order to go to fulfill the order, but stopped and said:

- Yes, sir, a struty horse, right, at least sell, because he, Pavel Ivanovich, is a completely scoundrel; He is such a horse, just do not bring God, only a hindrance.

- Yes! I'll go, run to the market to sell!

-By golly, Pavel Ivanovich, he just looks like a casual, but in fact the most crafty horse; Such a horse is nowhere ...

- Fool! When I want to sell, I will sell it. Still set off in reason! I’ll look at now: if you don’t give me Kuznetsov now, and at two o’clock everything will not be ready, so I will give you such a brawl ... You won’t see your own face! Go! Go!

Selifan came out.

Chichikov became completely out of sorts and threw a saber to the floor, who went with him on the road to suggest proper fear to whom should he should. For about a quarter of an hour, he escaped with the blacksmiths, while he was praised, because the blacksmiths, as usual, were notorious scoundrels and, realizing that the work was needed for a hurry, broke exactly all the same. No matter how he was burning, he called them scammers, robbers, robbers passing, even hinted at the Last Judgment, but Kuznetsov did not penetrate anything: they completely withstood the character - not only did not retreat from the price, but even escorted for work instead of two hours and half a half and half . During this time, he had the pleasure of experiencing pleasant minutes known to every traveler, when everything is laid in the suitcase and only ropes, pieces of paper and different sides are lying in the room, when a person does not belong to the road or to the seat in place, sees from the window passing from the window Weaving people who interpret their hryvnias and with some stupid curiosity raising their eyes, so that, looking at him, to continue their path again, which is even more emitted by the dislike of the poor, unhapping traveler. Everything that is, everything that he sees: both a nap against his windows and the head of an old woman, living in a opposite house suitable for a window with short curtains, is all nasty to him, but he does not leave the window. It is worth it, then paying some kind of dulled attention to everything that moves and does not move in front of him, and strangles with an annoyance some fly that buzzes and beats against the glass under his finger. But everything happens to the end, and the desired minute came: everything was ready, in front of Brichka was properly established, the wheel was covered with a new tire, the horses were given from the watering, and the robbers went to the blacksmiths, counting the obtained battery ones and wishing well -being. Finally, both the Brichka was laid down, and two hot kalach, just bought, were put there, and Selifan already put something in his pocket, which was in a pocket, who was at the Kucher goat, and the hero himself finally, when waved by a sexual cards, which stood in the same Demikotonov The frock coat, under tavern and alien lackers and coachmen who gathered to say hello, how someone else's master leaves, and under all other circumstances accompanying the exit, sat in the crew, and the brown, in which bachelors, which stood in the city for so long, can be, maybe maybe it can, maybe I was tired of the reader, finally left the hotel gate. "Glory to those, Lord!" - thought Chichikov and crossed himself. Selifan shook a whip; At first, the parsley hung at first on the footing of Parsley, and the hero, sitting better on the Georgian rug, laid down his leather pillow, squeezed two hot kalachs, and the crew went again to dance and sway thanks to the pavement, which, as you know, had a throwing back. power. With some uncertain feeling, he looked at the winter, walls, fence and streets, which also on his part, as if jumping, slowly went back and which, God knows whether he was judged by the fate to see ever in the continuation of his life. When turning in one of the streets, Brichka was supposed to stop, because an endless funeral procession passed through its entire length. Chichikov, leaning, ordered Parsley to ask who was buried and found out that the prosecutor was buried. Filled unpleasant sensations, he hid the same hour into a corner, closed himself with his skin and drew the curtains. At this time, when the crew was thus stopped, Selifan and Parsley, devalently removing his hat, considered who, how, in what and on what he was driving, considering the number, how many and foot and roding, and the master, ordered them not to admit not to admit to them And not to bow to any of the lackey’s acquaintances, he also began to consider timidly through the glass that were in leather curtains: all the officials walked behind the coffin, taking off their hats. He began to be afraid so that they would not recognize his crew, but they were not up to that. They did not even engage in various everyday conversations that the escorting deceased usually lead among themselves. All their thoughts were concentrated at this time in themselves: they thought that the new Governor General would be what would take up the job and how they would take them. The officials who were walking on foot were followed by carriages from which ladies looked in mourning caps. By the movements of the lips and their hands, it was clear that they were busy with a living conversation; Maybe they also talked about the arrival of the new governor-general and made assumptions about the balls that he would give, and they bustled about their eternal scisters and seizures. Finally, behind the carriages there were several empty yeasts stretched out by the gouck, finally nothing left, and our hero could go. Opening leather curtains, he sighed, saying from the heart: “Here, the prosecutor! He lived, lived, and then died! And they will print in the newspapers that he died, to the register of subordinates and all mankind, a respectable citizen, a rare father, an exemplary spouse, and will write a lot of things; Perhaps they would add that they were accompanied by wings and orphans; But if you disassemble the business well, so in fact you just had a thick eyebrows. ” Then he ordered Selifan to go as soon as possible and, meanwhile, thought to himself: “This is, however, it’s good that the funeral met; They say that it means happiness if you meet the dead man. ”

Brick, meanwhile, turned into more deserted streets; Soon, only long wooden fences were drawn, foreshadowing the end of the city. The pavement is already over, and the barrier, and the city of the Nazadi, and there is nothing, and again on the road. And again, on both sides of the column path, miles, station tires, wells, carts, gray villages with samovars, women and a brunim bearded master, running from an inn with an oats in his hand, a pedestrian in worn -out bast shoes, woven over eight hundred miles, town and townspeople, town , built alive, with wooden shops, flour barrels, bast shoes, kalachi and other fragments, ripples, cleaned bridges, omnipotal fields and on the other side and on the other, landlords, [79] soldiers on horseback on a horse, taking a green box with a pig Peas and signature: such and such artillery battery, green, yellow and freshly defamed black stripes flickering along the steppes, a song, pine tops in a fog, which disappeared in a fog, raven like flies and a horizon without end ... Rus'! Rus! I see you, from my wonderful, beautiful far, I see you: poor, scattered and unacceptable in you; They will not amuse, the daring sofa of nature, crowned with impudent art sofas, cities with multi -willed tall palaces, have grown into the cliffs, picture wood and ivy, grown into houses, in noise and in the eternal dust of waterfalls, will not be amused. The head will not overturn back to look at the stone blocks that are bulging endlessly above it and in the height; The dark arches, entangled by grape bitch, ivy and inconspicuous millions of wild roses, did not flash through the other, they did not flash through them in the distance the eternal lines of shining mountains rushing into silver clear skys. Openly deserted and even in you; Like points, like badges, low cities sticking out among the plains among the plains; Nothing will be seduced and not fascinating the gaze. But what incomprehensible, secret power attracts to you? Why is your dreary, rushing through the entire length and width of your sea, from sea to sea, is heard and heard in your ears? What is in it, in this song? What is calling and sobbing, and grabs the heart? What sounds are painfully kissing, and striving into the soul, and curl near my heart? Rus! What do you want from me? What incomprehensible connection lurks between us? What do you look like that, and why everything that is in you turned my eyes full of full expectations? .. And still, full of bewilderment, I stand motionless, and the chapter has already dawned on the formidable cloud, heavy coming rains, and the thought was numb before yours space. What prophesies this immense scope? Is it here, is it not to be born in an infinite thought when you yourself are endlessly? Is it not to be a hero when there is a place where to turn around and walk? And menacingly embraces me with a powerful space, reflecting with terrible strength in my depths; Unnatural power, my eyes lit up: y! What a sparkling, wonderful, unfamiliar land! Rus!..

- Hold on, hold, fool! - shouted Chichikov Selifan.

- Here I am a jack of you! - shouted a courier galloping towards a mustache with a mustache in arshin. “You don’t see, the goblin is your soul: the state crew!” - And, as a ghost, the three disappeared with thunder and dust.

What a strange, and alluring, and bearing, and wonderful in the word: road! And how wonderful it is, this road: a clear day, autumn leaves, cold air ... stronger in a road overcoat, a hat on the ears, closely and more comfortable to the corner! The last time running a shiver grabbed the members, and already changed her pleasant warmth. The horses rush ... How seductively sneaks of a nap and laughs, and already through the dream, “not white snow”, and the SAP of horses, and the noise of the wheels are heard, and already snore, pressing to the corner of your neighbor. Woke up: five stations ran back; The moon, an unknown city, churches with old wooden domes and blackening wit, dark log and white stone houses. The radiance of the month there and there: as if white linen shawls hung along the walls, along the pavement, along the streets; They cross their shoals with black shadows, like coal; Like the sparkling metal, illuminated wooden roofs shine, and nowhere is the soul - everything is sleeping. One is single, does the light squeamish somewhere in the window: does the tradesman be hidden by his couple of boots, is the baker fiddling in the stove-what about them? And night! Heavenly Forces! What night is performed in the height! And the air, and the sky, distant, tall, there, in the inaccessible depth of, so immensely, sonorously and clearly spread out! .. But the cold nightly breath is breathing freshly in the very eyes and lulls you off, and now you will be asleep, and you will forget, and you snore , and tossed angrily, feeling the heaviness, a poor, paused in the corner of a neighbor. I woke up - and again before you fields and steppe, nowhere - everywhere there is a wasteland, everything is open. A mileage with a digit flies in your eyes; Morning is engaged; On a white -white cold sky, a golden pale strip; The wind becomes fresh and tougher: more strongly in a warm overcoat! .. What a glorious cold! What a wonderful dream, again embracing you! Push - and again woke up. At the top of the sky the sun. “Fighter! easier!" - the voice is heard, the cart descends from the steep: below the dam is a wide and wide clear pond, shining like a copper bottom in front of the sun; the village, the huts scattered on the slope; Like a star, shines aside the cross of the rural church; The chatter of men and unbearable appetite in the stomach ... God! How good you are sometimes, distant, distant road! How many times, as a dying and drowning, I grabbed for you, and every time you generously carried me out and saved me! And how many wonderful ideas were born in you, poetic dreams, how many marvelous impressions were felt! .. But our friend Chichikov felt not at all prose dreams. And let's see how he felt. At first he did not feel anything and looked only back, wanting to instill if he had left the city; But when he saw that the city had long disappeared, neither forges, nor mills, nor all that was around the cities, was visible and even the white tops of the stone churches had long gone into the ground, he took up only one road, looked only to the right and left , and the city of N. as if he had not been in his memory, as if he had traveled him for a long time, in childhood. Finally, the road stopped taking him, and he began to slightly close his eyes and bow his head to the pillow. The author admits that this is even happy to find, thus, the case of talking about his hero; For hitherto, as the reader saw, he was constantly interfered with either nostril, or balls, then the ladies, then city gossip, then, finally, thousands of those little things that seem only then trifles when they are included in the book, and for now they turn in the light, revered for Very important things. But now we will put aside completely and directly go about it.

It is very doubtful that the readers like the hero we have chosen. The ladies will not like him, this can be said in the affirmative, because the ladies demand that the hero be decisive perfection, and if some sincere or bodily spot, then trouble! No matter how deeply the author to look into his soul, even though it reflects the purer of the mirror of his image, they will not give him any price. Chichikov’s full -scale and middle summer will damage him a lot: in no case, the hero will not forgive the hero, and very many ladies, having shifted, say: “Fi, so ugly!” Alas! All this is known to the author, and for all that he cannot take the heroes of a virtuous person, but ... maybe in this very story, other, still hitherto not fat strings, will appear, the myriad of the Russian spirit will appear, a husband, gifted with divine valor, will pass, gifted, gifted. Or a wonderful Russian girl, which not to find anywhere in the world, with the entire marvelous beauty of the female soul, all of the generous aspiration and selflessness. And all the virtuous people of other tribes will seem dead before them, how the book is dead before a living word! The Russian movements will rise ... And they will see how deeply the Slavic nature was gone in what slipped only by the nature of other peoples ... But why and why talk about what ahead? It is indecent to the author, having long been a husband, raised by a harsh inner life and fresh sobriety of solitude, to be forgotten like a young man. Everything is its own turn, and place and time! But a virtuous person is still not taken into heroes. And one might even say why they are not taken. Because it is time to finally give rest to a poor virtuous person, because the word “virtuous man” rotates idly on the lips; Because they turned a virtuous man to the horse, and there is no writer who would not go on him, drooping both a whip, and everything fell; Because they changed their virtuous person to the point that now there is no shadow of virtue on him, and only the ribs and the skin remained instead of the body; because a virtuous person is hypocritically called; Because they do not respect a virtuous person. No, it's time to finally hide the scoundrel. So, hiding a scoundrel!

The dark and modest origin of our hero is dark and modest. The parents were nobles, but the pillar or personal - God knows; He did not look like them with his face: at least a relative who was at his birth, a low, short woman, who is usually called Pygalis, picking up a child, cried out: “He completely went out the way I thought! He should go to the grandmother from the mother of the side, which would be better, and he was born simply, as the proverb says: neither in his mother, nor in his father, but in the carriageway. " At the beginning, life looked at him somehow sweetly, through some kind of muddy, snow-covered window: neither a friend, nor a comrade in childhood! Little Gorenka with small windows, who did not open in the winter or in the summer, a father, a sick person, in a long frock coat on Merlushki and in knitted cotton, worn on a barefoot leg, who was constantly breathing, walking around the room, and singing a sandbox in a corner standing in a corner , the eternal seat on the bench, with a pen in the hands, ink on the fingers and even on the lips, the eternal sign in front of the eyes: “Do not lie, obey the eldest and carry virtue in the heart”; The eternal scarc and the spanking of the room of cotton, a familiar, but always harsh voice: “again blew!”, Retreating at a time when the child, bored with the uniformity of labor, attached some quotation or tail to the letter; And an eternally familiar, always unpleasant feeling, when, following your words, the edge of his ear was twisted very painfully with the nails of the long fingers stretching behind him: here is a poor picture of his original childhood, about which he barely retained a pale memory. But in life, everything changes quickly and vividly: on one day, with the first spring sun and spilled streams, his father, having taken his son, went with him on a cart, which was dragged by a flying gun [80] a naughty horse, known among horse ladies under the name of Sorky; She ruled Kucher, a little pink salmon, the ancestor of the only serf family belonging to Chichikov’s father, who held almost all positions in the house. They dragged on Soroka and a half days with a liner; They spent the night on the road, crossed the river, bite with a cold pie and fried lamb, and only on the third day they reached the city in the morning. In front of the boy, city streets flashed unexpected splendor, forcing him to open his mouth for several minutes. Then the sorke bolt, along with the cart into the pit, which began a narrow lane, all striving down and damaged with mud; She worked there for a long time and kneaded her legs, incented to both the hunchback and the master himself, and finally dragged them into a small courtyard, standing on a slope with two blossomed apple trees before an old house and a kindergarten behind his low, small, consisting only of mountain ash, Buzins and hiding in the depths of her wooden booth, covered with a boat, with a narrow matte window. Here they lived a relative of them, a flabby old woman who had still walking all morning to the market and then dried his stockings at the samovar, who patted the boy on the cheek and admired his fullness. Then he had to stay and go daily to the classes of the city school. Father, spending the night, got out on the road the same day. When parting tears, it was not spilled from the parental eyes; Dana was half a copper for consumption and goodies and, more importantly, smart instruction: “Look, Pavlush, study, not dope and not hindle, but most of all, please teachers and bosses. If you please the boss, then, although in science you will not have time and God did not give talent, you will be used and you will be ahead of all. Not driven with comrades, they will not teach you good; And if it has already gone to that, so driven with those who are richer so that on occasion you can be useful. Do not treat and do not treat anyone, but behave better so that you are treated to be treated, and most of all, take care and copy of a penny: this thing is most reliable in the world. A comrade or friend will inflate you and the first in trouble will give you out, but the penny will not give you out, no matter what trouble you are. You will do everything and sew everything in the world with a penny. ” Having giving such an instruction, his father broke up with his son and dragged home again on his sorca, and since then he had never seen him anymore, but the words and instructions have gored deep into his soul.

Pavlush from the other days began to go to classes. There were no special abilities for any science in it; He distinguished himself more than diligence and neatness; But on the other hand, it turned out to be a large mind on the other side, from the side of the practical one. He suddenly realized and understood the matter and behaved in relation to his comrades in exactly the way that they treated him, and he not only never, but even sometimes, having hidden the treated reflection, then sold them. As a child, he knew how to deny himself everything. From this father, half a tint did not restrain a dime, on the contrary - in the same year he had already made increments to her, showing the werewolfishness almost unusual: he blinded from the wax of the snowfire, painted it and sold it very profitably. Then, for some time, he settled on other speculations, these are exactly what: having bought a food in the market, he sat down in the classroom near those that were richer, and as soon as he noticed that his comrade was starting to feel sick- a sign of an approaching starvation- he protruded from him out of- Under the benches, it was as if by chance the corner of the gingerbread or roll and, having raised it, took money, thinking with appetite. For two months, he escaped in his apartment without a vacation near the mouse, which he planted in a small wooden cell, and finally achieved to the point that the mouse stood on the hind legs, laid down and got up by order, and then sold it very profitably. When it took money to five rubles, he sewed the bag and began to save in another. In relation to the authorities, he behaved even smarter. No one knew how to sit on the bench so quietly. It must be noted that the teacher was a great fan of silence and good behavior and could not stand smart and sharp boys; It seemed to him that they must certainly laugh at him. It was enough for the one who came to the remark from the Ostrome, it was enough for him to only move or somehow inadvertently blink an eyebrow in order to suddenly fall under anger. He drove him and punished him mercilessly. “I, brother, will expel arrogance and rebellion from you! He said. “I know you through how you do not know yourself.” Here you are on my knees! You’ll have a time! ” And the poor boy, not knowing why, rubbed his knees and starved on days. “Abilities and talents? This is all nonsense, ”he used to say,“ I look only at the behavior. ” I will put full points in all sciences to the one who does not know the Aza, but behaves commendably; And in whom I see a bad spirit and mocking, I am zero, although he shut up the Solona by the belt! ” So the teacher said, who did not like to death Krylov for saying: “For me, it is better to drink, but it is a reason,” and always talking with pleasure in his face and in the eyes, as in the school where he taught before, There was such a silence that it was heard how the fly was flying; That none of the students during the round year coughed and did not turn out in the classroom and that it was impossible to find out if anyone was there or not. Chichikov suddenly suffered the spirit of the boss and what the behavior should consist of. He did not move either an eye or an eyebrow at all the time of the class, no matter how he pinned him from behind; As soon as the bell was heard, he rushed to the reup and handed the teacher before all the trees (the teacher walked in Treuha); Having served the Treukh, he went out of the first class and tried to get caught by him three times on the road, constantly taking off his hat. The case was perfect success. During his stay at the school, he was on an excellent account and, when issued, received a complete certification in all sciences, a certificate and a book with gold letters for approximate diligence and trustworthy behavior. Leaving the school, he found himself a young man of a rather tempting appearance, with a chin who demanded a razor. At this time, his father died. The inheritance were four Fufikes, two old grades, lined with Merlushki, and a small amount of money. Father, apparently, was only known to me to save a penny in the council, and he accumulated it a little. Chichikov immediately sold the Old Darrecta with an insignificant land for a thousand rubles, and transferred the family to the city, arranged in it and engage in the service in it. At the same time, he was kicked out of the school for stupidity or other guilt, a poor teacher, a lover of silence and commendable behavior. The teacher began to drink with grief; Finally he had nothing to drink; The sick, without a piece of bread and help, he disappeared somewhere in an inaccurated forgotten conifur. His former students, clever men and witches, in which he had an incessant rebellion and arrogant behavior, having learned about his miserable position, raised money for him immediately, selling even a lot of necessary; Only Pavlush Chichikov dissuaded him with lack of non-intelligence and gave some nickle of silver, which the comrades immediately abandoned him, saying: “Oh, you lived!” The poor teacher closed his face with his hands when he heard his former students about such an act; Tears in hail poured out of the extinguished eyes, like in the powerless child. “At the expense of death, God brought to cry,” he said in a weak voice and sighed heavily, hearing about Chichikov, adding immediately: “Eh, Pavlush! This is how a person changes! After all, what a well -free, nothing violent, silk! I pouted, pouted a lot ... "

It is impossible, however, to say that the nature of our hero was so harsh and blackened and his feelings were before dulled so that he did not know either pity or compassion; He felt both, he would even like to help, but only so that it did not consist in a significant amount, so as not to touch the money that was supposed not to touch; In a word, the paternal instruction: take care and copy of a penny - went for the future. But there was no attachment to money for money for money; They were not possessed by hunching and stinginess. No, they did not move them: he seemed ahead of life in all contentment, with all sorts of prosperity; Crews, a house, perfectly arranged, delicious dinners - that’s what was constantly worn in his head. In order to finally, over time, will certainly taste all this, that is why a penny was saved, sparingly refused to time and to himself and another. When his rich man rushed past the span beautiful yeasts, on the trotches in a rich harness, he stopped in his tracks in the spot and then, waking up, like after a long sleep, he said: “But there was a guessor, his hair wore a circle!” And everything that did not respond with wealth and contentment made an impression on him, incomprehensible to himself. Leaving the school, he did not even want to relax: it was so much a desire to get down to business and service. However, despite the commendable certificates, with great difficulty he decided in the state ward. And in the distant provincials you need a patronage! He got the place insignificant, salary of thirty or forty rubles a year. But he decided to warmly engage in service, to defeat and overcome everything. And for sure, self -confirmation, patience and restriction of needs, he showed unheard of. From early morning until late in the evening, not tired of neither spiritual nor bodily forces, he wrote, migrating all into stationery, did not go home, slept in clerical rooms on the tables, sometimes lunch with the watchmen and, with all that, knew how to maintain neatness, dress up decently , tell your face a pleasant expression and even something noble in movements. It must be said that tent officials were especially distinguished by nondescence and unfamiliarity. Others had faces, as if badly baked bread: the cheek was inflated in one direction, the chin rushed to the other, the upper lip was introduced by the bubble, which also cracked into the increase to that; In a word, completely ugly. They spoke all somehow severely, in such a voice, as if they were going to beat someone; They made frequent sacrifices to Baccu, showing in such a way that in the Slavic nature there are still many remains of paganism; They even sometimes came to the presence, as they say, having gone, which is why in the presence it was not good and the air was not at all aromatic. Between such officials, Chichikov could not but be noticed and distinguished, representing in everything the perfect opposite of the face, and the friendliness of the voice, and there were no strong drinks perfectly with perfect drinks. But with all that, his road was difficult; He fell under the bosses to an elderly ranger, [81] who was the image of some stone insensibility and non-condensation: forever the same, impregnable, never in his life, who had never appeared on his face, which had never welcomed even anyone with a request for health. No one saw him at least once to be what always, even on the street, at least at home; At least once he showed in something participation, if only he had drunk drunk and would laugh in drunkenness; If only he would indulge in a wild fun, which the robber is indulging in a drunken moment, but even the shadow was nothing in him. There was nothing even in him: neither the villainous nor the good, and something terrible was in this absence of everything. His callousness is his face, without any sharp incorrectness, did not hint at any similarity; In severe proportionality, there were features of him. Only frequent mountain ash and bumps that spent them, ranked him to one of those who, according to folk expression, featured peas at night. It seemed that there were no human strength to get to such a person and attract his location, but Chichikov tried. At first he began to please in all kinds of inconspicuous trifles: he carefully examined the chink of the feathers that he wrote, and, having prepared somewhat according to their model, put them by his arm every time; his sand and tobacco blocked and swept off the table; started a new rag for his inkwell; I found somewhere his hat, a nipple hat, which ever existed in the world, and each time put it near him a minute before the end of the presence; He cleaned his back if he stained her with chalk against the wall - but all this remained decisively without any remark, as if there was nothing of this and did. Finally, he sniffed his home, family life, found out that he had a mature daughter, with his face, also similar to that as if he had a threshing pea at night. From this side he came up with an attack. I found out what church she came to on Sundays, he became an appropriate her, purely dressed, dried up a very shirt, and the success was successful: a harsh stiffler staggered and called him for tea! And in the office did not have time to look around, as the matter was so that Chichikov moved to his house, became a necessary and necessary person, bought both flour and sugar, handed it with his daughter, as with the bride, the toll called his dad and kissed him in his hand; Everyone put in the ward that at the end of February there would be a wedding in front of the great post. The harsh flower even began to bother for him from his superiors, and after a few time the chichiks himself sat down on one vacant place that opened. This seemed to be the main goal of his connections with the old stoker, because he immediately sent his chest home and found himself in another apartment the next day. The tenster stopped calling dad and did not kiss his hand anymore, and the thing about the wedding hesitated, as if nothing had happened at all. However, meeting with him, he every time he kindly sorry for his hand and invited him to tea, so that the old ranger, despite the eternal immobility and callousness of indifference, shook his head and pronounced under his breath: “He pouted, the Devil's son. ! "

It was the most difficult threshold through which he stepped over. From this time it went easier and more successful. He became a noticeable person. Everything turned out to be in it, which is needed for this world: enjoyability in revolutions and actions, and painfulness in business affairs. With such means, he got in a short time what is called a bread place, and took advantage of it in a great way. You need to know that at the same time the strictest persecution of all sorts of bribes began; He was not afraid of persecution and turned them in the same hour in his favor, thus showing directly Russian ingenuity, which is only during a snore. The case was arranged like that: as soon as the petitioner came and put his hand in his pocket in order to pull out from there well -known letters signed by the signature of Prince Khovansky, as expressed in Russia: “No, no,” he said with a smile, holding his hands, holding his hands. - you think that I ... no, no. This is our duty, our duty, without any retribution, we must do! From this side, be dead: tomorrow everything will be done. Let me know your apartment, you don’t need to take care of yourself, everything will be brought to your house. ” The fascinated petitioner returned home almost enthusiastic, thinking: “Finally, a man who needs more is just a precious diamond!” But the petitioner is waiting for the day, the other, do not bring business to the house, to the third too. He is in the office, the matter did not begin; He is to a precious diamond. “Ah, sorry! - Chichikov said very courteously, grabbing him by both hands, - we had so many things; But tomorrow everything will be done, tomorrow certainly, right, it’s even ashamed to me! ” And all this was accompanied by charming movements. If at the same time the floor of the dressing gown was opened somehow, then the hand at the same moment tried to correct and hold the floor. But neither tomorrow, nor the day after tomorrow, nor on the third day, they are talking about home. The petitioner takes up the mind: but full, is there anything? Scravs; They say that the clerks must be given. “Why not give? I am ready a quarter, another. " “No, not a quarter, but a little white.” - "On white clerks!" - cries the petitioner. “Why are you so hot? - They answer him, - it will come out, clerks and get a quarter, and the rest will go to the authorities. " An inaccessible supplicant beats himself on the forehead and scolds on what the light is a new order of things, the persecution of bribes and the polite, ennobled appeals of officials. I knew before, at least what to do: I brought the ruler of Red things, [82] Yes, and now in the hat, and now you’ll be transported, and you are still a week while you guess; Damn the disinterestedness and bureaucratic nobility! The petitioner, of course, is right, but now there are no bribe takers: all the rulers of affairs are honest and noblest people, the secretaries only and the clerk are scammers. Soon Chichikov was much more liability: a commission was formed for building some kind of state-owned very capital structure. He was attached to this commission, and turned out to be one of the active members. The commission immediately got down to business. For six years she was busy near the building; But the climate, or something, interfered, or the material was already like that, only the state building did not go above the foundation. Meanwhile, in other ends of the city, each of the members at a beautiful house of civil architecture found himself: it is evident that the soil of the earth was better there. The members already began to prosper and began to start a family. Then only and now only Chichikov began to gradually get out of the harsh laws of abstinance and his inexorable selflessness. Here, only the long -term post was finally softened, and it turned out that he was always not alien to different pleasures, from which he knew how to stay in the summer with an ardent of youth, when not a single person was completely powerful over his own. There were some excesses: he started a pretty good cook, thin Dutch shirts. He had already bought a cloth for himself the whole province, and since then he began to hold on more brown and reddish colors with the spark; He had already acquired an excellent pair and held one leader himself, forcing the attacked one to twist with a ring; He already started the custom of wiping himself with a sponge soaked in water mixed with cologne; He already bought some kind of soap very expensive to communicate smoothness to the skin, already ...

But suddenly, a new boss, a military, strict man, the enemy of bribe takers and everything that is called untruth, was sent to the place of the former Tyufyak. The next day, he scared everyone to one, demanded reports, saw shortcomings, at every step the missing amounts, noticed at the same minute the house of beautiful civilian architecture, and a bulkhead went. Officials were set aside; The houses of civil architecture entered the treasury and were turned to various charitable establishments and schools for cantonists, [83] everything was flooded in the fluff, and Chichikov more than others. His face suddenly, despite pleasantness, did not like the boss, why exactly, God is in charge - sometimes even there is simply no reason for this - and he hated him to death. And the thunder was strong for everyone in an inexorable boss. But since he was a military man, therefore, he did not know all the intricacies of civilian drawings, after a few time, through true appearance and skillful to be faked, other officials wiped him into mercy, and the general soon found himself in the hands of even more scammers whom he did not read at all; I was even pleased that I finally chose people properly, and boasted not in a joke with subtle reduction to distinguish their abilities. The officials suddenly suffered his spirit and character. Everything that was under his superiors became terrible persecutors of untruth; Everywhere, in all matters, they pursued her, as a fisherman harsh pursues some fleshy Beluga, and pursued her with such a success that soon everyone found several thousand capital. At this time, many of the former officials turned to the path of truth and were again accepted to the service. But Chichikov could not have rubbed in any way, no matter how hard he tried and stood for him, the first general secretary, which was touched by the letters of Prince Khovansky, comprehended completely managing the general’s nose, but then he resolutely could not do anything. The general was a person who, although they drove by the nose (however, without his knowledge), but already, if any thought was sown in his head, then she was like an iron nail there: it was impossible to rub her from there from there . Everything that the smart secretary could do was the destruction of a stooped track record, and he already moved the boss only as compassion, depicting the touching fate of the unfortunate family of Chichikov, who, fortunately, had no live colors.

"Well! - said Chichikov, - hooked - anger, fell off - do not ask. I cry the grief not to equip, you need to do the job. ” And now he decided to see a quarry to start, again arm himself with patience, to limit himself to everything again, no matter how much and was well turned around before. It was necessary to move to another city, there is still informing yourself. Everything somehow did not stick. Two, three positions should have changed in the shortest time. The posts were somehow dirty, low. You need to know that Chichikov was the most decent person who ever existed in the light. Although he had to first wipe in a dirty society, he always retained cleanliness in his soul, he loved that there were noble tables in the chancellers and everything would be noble. He never allowed himself in a speech of a unforgettable word and was always offended if in the words of others he saw the lack of proper respect for the rank or rank. I think it will be pleasant to the reader to find out that he has changed the laundry on himself all sorts of two days, and in the summer during the frying even every day: every unpleasant odor has already insulted him. For this reason, whenever Parsley came to undress him and throw his boots, put a clove in his nose, and in many cases his nerves were sensitive, like a girl; And therefore it was difficult for him to find himself again in those ranks where everything spoke with a pennication and indecent in actions. No matter how he was attached to the spirit, but he lost weight and even green during such adversity. He was already starting to get full and come into those round and decent forms in which the reader found him when concluding with him, and more than once, looking in the mirror, he thought about a lot of pleasant: about the woman, about the nursery, and the smile followed with such thoughts; But now, when he looked at himself somehow inadvertently in the mirror, he could not help but cry: “You are my Most Holy Mother! What the ugly I became! " And after a long time I did not want to look. But he transferred everything to our hero, transferred it strongly, patiently transferred, and - finally moved to the customs service. It must be said that this service has long been a secret subject of his thoughts. He saw what kind of dandruff overseas gigrants customs officials started, what porcelain and battles sent to kumushki, aunts and sisters. He had already spoke with a sigh for a long time: “That's where to cross: the border is close and enlightened people, and with what thin Dutch shirts you can get!” It must be added that at the same time he was thinking about the special variety of French soap, which informed extraordinary whiteness of the skin and freshness of cheeks; As it was called, God knows, but, according to His assumptions, it was certainly on the border. So, he would have wanted to go to customs long ago, but they kept current various benefits in the construction commission, and he reasoned fairly that the customs, be that as it may, was still no more than a crane in the sky, and the commission was already a tit in his hands. Now he decided at all costs to get to customs, and reached. He began his service with unusual jealousy. It seemed that fate itself determined him to be a customs official. Similar quickness, insight and insight was not only not seen, but not even heard. In three to four weeks, he already filled his hand in the customs business so much that he knew everything decisively: he didn’t even weigh, did not measure, but by texture he found out how much the arshin of the cloth or other matter is in which a piece of the cloth; Having taken a bundle in his hand, he could suddenly say how many pounds in him. As for the searches, here, as even the comrades themselves put it, he just had a dog flair: it was impossible not to be amazed, seeing how he got so much patience to feel all kinds of button, and all this was done with murderous composure, polite Until incredible. And at a time when the searchers were furious, lost their temper and felt an evil motivation to beat his pleasant appearance with clicks, he, without changing in the face or polite deeds, said only: “Would you like to worry a little and get up?” Or: “Would you like to, ma'am, to melt into another room? There, the wife of one of our officials will explain with you. ” Or: “Let me, here I will scamp the lining of your overcoat a little with a knife” - and, saying this, he pulled out shawls, scarves, cold -blooded, like from his own chest. Even the authorities explained that it was a devil, not a man: he was looking for in wheels, a drawbar, [84] horsepower ears and the same in which places, wherever any author came into the idea of ​​climbing and where only one customs officials were allowed to climb. So the poor traveler who crossed the border, still for several minutes, could not come to his senses and, wiping the sweat, who acted with a small rash all over his body, only baptized and said: “Well, well!” His situation was very similar to the position of a schoolboy who ran out of the secret room, where the boss called him in order to give some instruction, but instead carved in a completely unexpected way. In a short time there was no life from him to the smugglers. It was the thunderstorm and despair of all Polish Judaism. Honesty and incurred were irresistible, almost unnatural. He did not even make up a small capital from different confiscated goods and the selected some gizmos who did not enter the treasury in order to avoid unnecessary correspondence. Such a zealous-bearing service could not but become the subject of general surprise and not finally reach the attention of the authorities. He received the rank and increase and after that he presented the project to catch all the smugglers, asking only to fulfill it himself. He was awarded the same hour and an unlimited right to make all sorts of searches. This only he wanted. At that time, a strong society of smugglers was formed in an thought-in-correct manner; A daring enterprise promised millions. He had long had a reduction about him and even refused to bribe him, saying dryly: "Not the time." Having received everything at his disposal, at the same moment he let the society know, saying: "Now it's time." The calculation was too correct. Here in one year he could get something that he would not win at twenty years of the most zealous service. Before, he did not want to enter into any relations with them, because he was no more than a simple pawn, therefore, he would have received a little; But now ... Now it’s a completely different matter: he could offer any conditions. In order for the matter to go more freely, he bowed another official, his comrade, who could not resist the temptation, despite the fact that his hair was sed. The conditions were concluded, and the society proceeded to action. The actions began brilliantly: the reader, without a doubt, heard so often a repeated story about the witty journey of the Spanish rams, which, having made a crossing the border in double sheepskin coats, carried under the sheepskihan to a million brabant lace. This incident happened precisely when Chichikov served at customs. Do not participate in this enterprise himself, no Jews in the world could be carried out by such a thing. After three or four lamb trips across the border, both officials found himself four hundred thousand capital. Chichikov, they say, even exceeded five hundred, because it was scable. God knows what a huge numbers the fertile amounts had increased if some difficult beast had not run across everything. The devil was confused by both officials; The officials, simply speaking, were overgrown and quarreled for nothing. Once in a hot conversation, or maybe a few and drinking, Chichikov called another official Popovich, and he, although he really was Popovich, does not know why he was abandoned cruelly and answered him immediately and unusually abruptly, just like that: “No, You're lying, I am a state adviser, not Popovich, but you are so Popovich! ” And then he also added to him in peak for more annoyance: "Yes, they say, what!" Although he flashed him in this way, turning the name to him the same, and although the expression "here, they say that!" It could be strong, but, displeased with Sim, he sent a secret denunciation to him. However, they say that they already had a quarrel for some kind of woman, fresh and strong, like a vigorous turnip, according to customs officials; that people were even bribed, in order to give our hero under the evening in a dark alley; But that both officials were in fools and a woman was used by some headquarters captain Shamsharev. As it was, in fact, God knows them; Better, the reader-hunter brings himself. The main thing is that secret relations with the smugglers became obvious. The state adviser, although he himself disappeared, but still leaned his comrade. The officials were taken under trial, confiscated, described everything that they had, and all this suddenly was allowed to thunder over their heads. As after the child they came to their senses and saw with horror what they had done. The state adviser, according to Russian custom, was washed down with grief, but College stood. He knew how to hide part of the money, no matter how sensitively the sense of the smell of the authorities who had eaten into the investigation. I used all the subtle headings of the mind, already too experienced, too well -known people: where he acted with pleasant speed, where he was a touching speech, where he smoked flattery, in no case do not damn things, where he dried the little one, in a word, he processed the case, at least, So that he was not set off with such dishonor as a comrade, and dodged from under the criminal court. But neither capital, nor different overseas gizmos, nothing remained for him; Other hunters were found for all this. He kept holding a dozen thousand, hidden about a rainy day, but dozen two Dutch shirts, and a small brichka, in which bachelors, and two serfs, coachman Selifan and Lacques Parsley, and customs officials driven by heart -to -heart, left him five or six of them, left him five or six Pilies of soap to save the freshness of the cheeks - that’s all. So, in what position our hero found himself again! This is what a bulk of disasters fell on his head! He called this: tolerate the truth. Now we could conclude that after such storms, trials, vicissitudes of fate and life he grief, he will leave with the remaining blood ten thousand-in-laws in some peaceful background of the county town and there will be stuck there [85] forever in the chintz robe by the window of a low house, analyzing the Sundays on Sundays For days, the fights of men, which arose before the windows, or for refreshing, walking into the chicken coop to feel the chicken appointed to the soup personally, and in this way the inseparable, but in its own way is also a heir -residential century. But it did not happen. It is necessary to give justice to the insurmountable strength of his character. After all that it would be enough if not to kill, then cool and pacify a person forever, an incomprehensible passion did not go out in him. He was in grief, in annoyance, grumbled to the whole world, was angry with the injustice of fate, indignant at the injustice of people and, however, could not abandon new attempts. In a word, he showed patience, before which is nothing a German wooden patience, concluded already in the slow, lazy circulation of his blood. Chichikov’s blood, on the contrary, played strongly, and it was necessary to have a lot of rational will to throw a depth on everything that would want to jump out and take a walk at large. He reasoned, and in his reasoning, a certain side of justice was visible: “Why am I? Why did trouble fall upon me? Who is yawning now for posts? - Everyone acquires. I did not make anyone unhappy: I did not rob a widow, I did not let anyone around the world, I used excess, I took where everyone would take it; I do not use, others would use. Why do others prosper, and why should I abuse the worm? And what am I now? Where am I going? What eyes will I look into the eyes of every venerable father of the family now? How not to feel my remorse, knowing that I will sprinkle the earth for nothing, and what my children will say later? Here, they say, father, cattle, did not leave us any state! ”

It is already known that Chichikov carefully cared about his descendants. Such a sensitive item! Other, perhaps, would not have launched a hand deeply, if it were not for a question that, unknown why, comes by himself: what will the children say? And here is the future ancestor, like a cautious cat, a sparkle with only one eye to the side, whether the owner is from where, everything that is closer to him is enough: is it worth it, whether the candles, the fat, the canary, whether she came under his paw - in a word, does not miss anything . So our hero complained and cried, but meanwhile, the activity did not die in his head; There everything wanted to build something and only waited for the plan. He cringed again, again began to lead a difficult life, again limited himself in everything, again out of purity and a decent position, he sank into mud and a low life. And in anticipation of the best, he was even forced to engage in the title of attorney, the title that had not yet acquired citizenship from all sides, poorly respected by small ordering and even the principals themselves, convicted of reptile in the front, rudeness and so on, but the need forced to decide on All. Of the assignments, he went, by the way, one thing: to pat on the laid in the Object Council [86] several hundred peasants. The estate was upset to the last extent. It was upset by scatter cases, rods, crop failures, rampant diseases that exterminated the best workers, and, finally, the stupid of the landowner, who removed the house in Moscow in the last taste and killed all his fortune to the last penny for this cleaning, so not What was there. For this reason, it was finally necessary to lay the last remaining estate. The contribution to the treasury was then a new business, which was decided not without fear. Chichikov as an attorney, having previously placed everyone (without a preliminary arrangement, as you know, there can not even be taken a simple certificate or straightening, yet at least a bottle of Madere will have to be poured into every throat), - so, having placed everyone who follows, he explained, he explained. that this is, by the way, the circumstance: half of the peasants died out, so that there were no bindings later ...

- Why are they listed according to the audit fairy tale? - said the secretary.

“They are listed,” answered Chichikov.

- Well, so why are you dumbfounded? - said the secretary, - one is dead, the other will be born, and everything is suitable.

The secretary, apparently, knew how to speak in rhyme. Meanwhile, the heroes of our hero dawned on the inspired thought of which ever came to the human head. “Oh, I'm akim is a simplet,” he said in himself, “I am looking for mittens, and both are behind my belt!” Yes, I’m bitting all these who died out, have not yet served new revision tales, to acquire them, let’s put them a thousand, yes, let’s say, the Object council will give two hundred rubles per soul: that's two hundred thousand capital! And now, the time is convenient, recently there was an epidemic, a lot has died out to the people, thank God. The landowners were asked for cards, bought and squandered properly; Everything climbed to St. Petersburg; The estates are abandoned, controlled, no matter how it hit, taxes are paid every year more difficult, so everyone will be happy to cede with joy, because only in order not to pay pervading money for them; Maybe another time it will happen that with another and I will also sew a penny for this. Of course, it is difficult, troublesome, scary to somehow get it, so as not to get out of this story. Well, after all, a person is given to something. And most importantly, it is good that the subject will seem incredible to everyone, no one will believe. True, you can neither buy nor lay it without land. Why, I will buy for the conclusion, to the conclusion; Now the lands in the Tauride and Kherson provinces are surrendered for nothing, only settled. I will move them all there! In Kherson them! Let them live there! And resettlement can be done legally, as follows in court. If they want to examine the peasants: perhaps I am not averse to, why not? I will present a certificate of my own signing of the captain-officer. The village can be called Chichikov Slobodka or by name given at baptism: Seltsi Pavlovskoye. ” And in this way, this strange plot was compiled in the head of our hero, for which, I don’t know if the readers will be grateful to him, and as a grateful the author is, it is difficult to express it. For whatever you say, this thought to Chichikov would not have come to the light of this poem.

Crossing Russian custom, he began execution. Under the guise of choosing a place for residence and under other pretexts, he undertook to look into both angles of our state, and mainly in those that have suffered more than others from accidents, crop failures, deaths and other things, in a word, where it would be more convenient and more convenient and more convenient and It is cheaper to buy the people's required people. He did not turn to any landowner at random, but elected people more to his taste or those that could be of less difficulties to make such transactions, trying to get to know before, so that, if possible, more than friendship, and not to purchase men. So, readers should not be indignant at the author, if the persons who were until now did not come to his taste: this is Chichikov’s fault, here he is a complete master, and where he wants, we must drag himself there. On our part, if, accurately, the accusation for the pallor and inconsistency of persons and characters will fall, we will only say that at first the entire broad leather and volume of business are never visible. The entrance to whatever the city, even in the capital, is always somehow pale; At first, everything is gray and monotonous: endless factories and factories are drawn, smoked with smoke, and then the corners of six -story houses, shops, signs, enormous prospects of streets, all in the bells, columns, statues, towers, with urban brilliance, noise and thunder and everyone are looking out. that a person’s hand and thought produced a marvel. How the first purchases were made, the reader has already seen; How will the matter go, what good luck and failures will be the hero, how to resolve and overcome it more difficult obstacles, how colossal images will appear, how the innermost levers of a wide story will move, her horizon will be crushed and all of it will take a majestic lyrical flow, then she will see later. There are still many ways to make the entire hiking crew consisting of a middle -aged master, in which bachelors, a footman of parsley, coachman of Selifan and the three horses, already known by name from the assessor to the scoundrel of the Chubaroy. So, that’s all our hero, what is it! But they will require, perhaps, the final definition by one damage: who is he regarding the qualities of moral? That he is not a hero performed by perfection and virtues, this is visible. Who is he? Therefore, the scoundrel? Why scoundrel, why be so strict to others? Now we have no scoundrels, there are well-intentioned people, pleasant people, and those who would put their physiognomy under a public slap in a public slaughter for universal shame, whether there are some two, three people, and they are already talking about virtue now. It is more fair to name him: the owner, acquirer. Acquisition - the fault of everything; Because of it, things were done to which the light gives the name not very clean. True, in this character there is already something repulsive, and the same reader who will be friendly with such a person on his life, will drive bread-salt with him and spend the time pleasantly, will look at him askance if he finds himself a hero Drama or poems. But the wise is one who does not disdain in any character, but, ahead of the subject look in it, produces it to its original reasons. Everything quickly turns into a person; You will not have time to look around, as a terrible worm has already grown inside, which autocraticly turned all life juices to him. And more than once, not only a broad passion, but an insignificant passion for something small grew in born to the best feats, forced him to forget the great and holy duties and in insignificant trinkets to see the great and holy. Human passions are countless, like sea sands, and all are not similar to one another, and all of them, low and beautiful, are initially submissive to man and then become terrible Lords. Blessed is the most beautiful passion for himself; Its immense bliss is growing and declining with every hour and a minute, and it enters deeper and deeper into the endless paradise of his soul. But there are passions that are not from a person. They were already born with him at the moment of his birth, and he was not given the strength to deviate from them. They are underway with the highest sketches, and there is something forever calling in them, not unreasonable in life. The Earthly Great Welcome is destined to be done to them: anyway, in a gloomy image or flying to a bright phenomenon, rejoiced in the world, they are equally caused for a good man unknown to a person. And, perhaps, in this very Chichikov, the passion, which attracts him, is no longer from him, and in his cold existence, what will then plunge into the dust and knees of a person before the wisdom of heaven. And another secret, why this image appeared in the poem that is now.

But it’s not difficult that the hero will be unhappy, the fact that the readers would be pleased with the same hero, the same hero, the same hero, would be pleased with the same hero. Do not look deeper the author to his soul, do not move her at the bottom of her that which eludes and hides from the light, do not discover the innermost thoughts that a person does not entrust to anyone else, but show him the way he seemed to the whole city, Manilov and other people, And everyone would be Radeshenka and would take him for an interesting person. There is no need that neither his face nor the whole image would rush about like alive before his eyes; But at the end of the reading, the soul is not alarmed by anything, and you can go back to the card table, which is inherent in all of Russia. Yes, my good readers, you would not want to see the discovered human poverty. Why, you say, what is it for? Do we not know that there is a lot of contempt and stupid in life? And without that, it happens to us often to see what is not comfortable at all. Better imagine us beautiful, fascinating. Let us better forget us! “Why are you, brother, tell me that things are going bad? - says the landowner to the clerk. - I, brother, know this without you, but do you have any other speeches, or what? You let me forget this, not to know this, then I am happy. " And here is the money that would have corrected any business, go to different means to bring themselves in oblivion. The mind is sleeping, maybe a sudden spring of great means; And there the estate is an account with an auction, and the landowner went to forget around the world with the soul, from extremely ready on basement, which he himself would be horrified before.

The author of the so -called patriots, who calmly sit in the corners and engage in completely extraneous business, accumulate the capital, accumulate the capitalists, organizing their fate at the expense of others; But as soon as something happens, according to their muni, offensive to the Fatherland, some book will appear, in which sometimes a bitter truth will affect, they will run out of all corners, like spiders that saw that they were confused into the cobweb web, and suddenly the screams will rise : “Is it good to bring it to the light, proclaim about it? After all, this is all that is described here, this is all ours - is it good? And what will foreigners say? Is it fun to hear a bad opinion about yourself? They think this does not hurt? They think, aren't we patriots? " On such wise remarks, especially about the opinions of foreigners, I admit, nothing can be taken in response. But is this: they lived in one remote corner of Russia two inhabitants. One was the father of the family, named Kifa Mokievich, a man of morality, who spent his life by a negligent manner. He did not engage in his family; His existence was turned more to the speculative direction and busy with the following, as he called, by the philosophical question: “For example, the beast,” he said, walking around the room, “the beast will be born naked. Why is it naked? Why isn't it like a bird, why doesn’t he hatch out of the egg? How, right, that: you won’t understand nature at all, as you delve into it more! ” So the inhabitant of Kifa Mokievich thought. But this is not the main thing. Another inhabitant was Moky Kifovich, his dear son. He was what the hero is called in Rus', and at the time when his father was engaged in the birth of the beast, his twenty -year -old shoulder nature was touched by his way to turn around. He did not know how to take a little: everything or his hand will crack, or the blister will jump on someone's nose. In the house and in the neighborhood, everything, from the courtyard girl to the courtyard dog, fled away, surrounding him; Even his own bed in the bedroom, he broke into pieces. Such was Moky Kifovich, but by the way, he was a good soul. But this is not the main thing. And the main thing is this: “Have mercy, Father Barin, Kifa Mokievich,” said her own and his own and alien ward, “what kind of Moky Kifovich you have?” There is no rest from him, such a conference! ”[87] -“ Yes, playful, playful, ”the father usually said to this,“ but how to be: It’s too late to fight him, and everyone will be accused of cruelty; And he is an ambitious man, reproach him with a third-third friend, he will disappear, but the publicity is the trouble! The city will find out, it will call him a completely dog. What, right, think, doesn’t it hurt? Am I not a father? That I am engaged in philosophy and sometimes there is no time, so I'm not a father? But no, father! Father, damn them, father! I have Moky Kifovich here sitting in my heart! - Then Kifa Mokievich beat himself very much in his chest with his fist and came to perfect excitement. “Well, if he remains a dog, then let him not learn about it from me, let me not betray him.” And, showing such a fatherly feeling, he left Mokia Kifovich to continue his exploits, and he himself turned to his beloved object again, asking himself some similar question: “Well, if the elephant was born in the egg, because the shell, tea would be strong Tolsta was, you won’t pierce a gun; It is necessary to invent some new gunshot gun. ” Thus, two inhabitants of a peaceful corner spent the life, which unexpectedly, like from a window, looked out at the end of our poem, looked out to answer modestly to the accusations from some hot patriots, who had been late for some philosophy or increase in the expense of the amounts gently The beloved by them of the Fatherland, who think not about not making the evil, but that they only do not say that they are doing bad. But no, not patriotism and not the first sense of the cause of the accusations, another is hidden under them. What to hide the word? Who, if not the author, must tell the holy truth? You are afraid of a deeply directed gaze, you are afraid to direct on something deep, you like to slide throughout the screening eyes. You will laugh even with the heart over Chichikov, maybe even praise the author, say: “However, he cleared up something cleverly, there should be a cheerful manner!” And after such words with double pride, turn to yourself, a smug smile will appear on your face, and you will add: “But you must agree, the elderly and prey are people in some provinces, and the scoundrels, moreover, are considerable!” And which of you, full of Christian humility, is not in the public, but in silence, one, in moments of secluded conversations with yourself, will deepen this difficult request into my own soul: "Is there any part of Chichikov in me?" Yes, no matter how! But pass at that time by his own acquaintance, having the rank of neither too big nor too small, he will push his neighbor at that moment and tell him, almost snorting with laughter: “Look, look, look, look, look, look, look. Won Chichikov, Chichikov went! " And then, like a child, having forgotten all decency, proper knowledge and years, he will run after him, teasing behind and saying: “Chichikov! Chichikov! Chichikov! "

But we began to speak quite loudly, having forgotten that our hero, who slept during the entire story of his story, had already woken up and could easily hear his last name so often. He is an offensive man and unhappy if he is explained about him disrespectfully. The reader of the spores, whether Chichikov will be angry with him or not, but as to the author, then he should never quarrel with his hero: he will have to go through a hand in a hand in a hand yet; Two large parts ahead is not a trifle.

-Eche-he! What are you? - said Chichikov Selifan, - you?

- What? Selifan said in a slow voice.

- Like what? Goose you! How are you going? Come on, touch!

And in fact, Selifan had long rode his eyes for a long time, occasionally only shaking the horses of the dozens of the dozes on the sides of the dozes; And from Parsley, for a long time, in what place the cartoon flew off, and he himself, having overturned his head, buried his head into Chichikov’s knee, so he had to give her a click. Selifan perked up and, having spat out several times on the back of the Chubaroy, after which he set off a trot, and waved a whip on top of all, smeared a thin singing voice: “Do not be afraid!” The horses stirred and carried, like fluff, a lighthead. Selifan only waved and shouted: “Eh! Eh! Eh! " - smoothly jumping on the goats, as the three flew into the hillock, then rushed the spirit from the hillock, which was dotted with the whole pillar road, striving a slightly noticeable roll down. Chichikov only smiled, flying slightly on his leather pillow, for he loved a quick ride. And what kind of Russian does not like fast driving? Whether it is a soul, striving to spin, walk, sometimes to say: "Damn everything!" “Is it not to love her to love her?” Should I not love her when something enthusiastically-art is heard in her? It seems that unknown power grabbed you on the wing to you, and you fly and all flies: miles fly, merchants fly towards their wagons, flies on both sides of the forest with dark systems of firs and pines, with an cloth and a brown scream, flies The whole road is where the missing distance is in the disappearance, and something terrible is imprisoned in this quick flicker, where the disappeared object does not have time to mean-only the sky above the head, and light clouds, and the widening month of one seem motionless. Eh, three! Bird Troika, who invented you? To know, you could only be born in the brisk people, in the land that I do not like to joke, and even crawled at half a might, and go count the miles until it charges you in your eyes. And not cunning, seeming, a road shell, not with an iron -shaped screw, but hastily alive with one ax and a chisel equipped and gathered you with a Yaroslavl, quick man. Not in German boots, a coachman: a beard and a mitten, and sits the devil knows what; And he got up, but he swung, but he tightened the song - the horses with a whirlwind, the knitting needles in the wheels mixed in one smooth circle, only the road trembled, and the stopped pedestrian cried out in the fright - and she rushed, rushed, rushed! How something is dusting and drilling air.

Is it not so you, Rus', that a brisk non -accurate three rushing? Smoke smokes under you road, the bridges rattles, everything is lagging behind and remains behind. The contemplator struck by God's miracle stopped: is it not lightning, dropped from the sky? What does it mean that is a terrifying movement? And what kind of unknown force is contained in these horses unknown by light? Eh, horses, horses, what kind of horses! Are they sitting in your mane? Is the ear sensitive in all your veins? They heard a familiar song from the heights, together and at once strained copper breasts and, almost without touching the hooves of the earth, turned into some elongated lines flying through the air, and all inspired by God rushes! .. WHERE you rushing? Give an answer. Does not give an answer. A bell is poured with a wonderful ringing; thunders and becomes the wind torn into pieces of air; Everything that is on the lands flies past, and, squinting, fixes and give her way other peoples and states.

Volume two [88]

Chapter first

Why expose the poverty of our life and our sad imperfection, digging people out of the wilderness, from remote lawns of the state? Well, to do if the writer is such a properties, and so he already fell ill with his own imperfection, and so he has already arranged his talent to portray him of the poverty of our life, digging people out of the wilderness, from remote zoomes of the state! And now we got into the wilderness again, again stumbled upon a nook sheet.

But what a wilderness and what nooks!

A thousand rushing rose rushing for a thousand and miles. Just like a gigantic shaft of some endless fortress, they rose above the plains with a yellowish break, in the form of a wall, with promoons and potholes, then a green rounded outplain, covered as a merlushki, a young bushes, rising from fraughters, then finally a dark forest still surviving from the ax. The river, faithful to its high shores, gave the corners and knees throughout the space with them, sometimes she went away from them, into the meadows, then, so that, wriggling there in a few writhing, shine like fire in front of the sun, hide in the grove Birch, aspen and Olkh and run out of there in the celebration, accompanying bridges, mills and dams, as if chasing it at any turn.

In one place, the steep sides of the elevations was pushed above the others and all from the bottom to the top was cleaned into the greens of the crowded dense trees. There was all together: maple, pear, and a stunted missile, and chiliga, and birch, and a spruce, and mountain ash, entangled with hops; Here ... [89] the red roofs of the Lord's buildings flickered, skates and crests of hiding huts and the upper superstructure of the Lord’s house, and over all this pile of trees and roofs, the old church offered its five playing tops. All of them were golden chopping crosses, attached to the domes with golden rubble chains, so that from afar it sparkled, as if in the air, not attached to anything, hanging gold. And all this bunch of trees, roofs, along with the church, overturning the tops down, surrendered to the river, where picturesque-bushy old willows, some standing off the coast, others completely in the water, lowering the branches and leaves there, as it were, as if examined this image who could not stop in all the continuation of their many years of life.

The view was very not enough, but the view from top to bottom, from the superstructure of the house to the plains and remote, was even better. A guest and visitor could not stand indifferently on the balcony. He was captured in his chest, and he could only utter: "Lord, how spacious here!" Spaces opened endlessly. Behind meadows, dotted groves and water mills, thick forests, like seas or fog, was far -poured, green and blue. Behind the forests, through the hazardous air, sandy sands. Behind the sands lay a crest in a remote sky, chalk mountains, shining with dazzling whiteness, even in an inclement time, as if illuminated their eternal sun. In some places light foggy-blue spots smoked along them. These were remote villages, but they could no longer consider the human eye. Only flashing, like a spark, a golden church poppy allowed to know that it was a crowded, large village. All this was clothed in the silence of the unappropriable, which was not awakened even by the echoes of the air singers who were slightly flying to the hearing, filling the air. In a word, the guest and visitor could not stand indifferently on the balcony, and after some two-hour contemplation, he published the same exclamation as in the first minute: “The forces of heaven, as it is spacious here!”

Who was the tenant of this village, to which, as an impregnable fortress, it was impossible to drive out of here, but it was necessary to drive up from the other side - fields, bread and, finally, a rare oak tree, spread out of green, up to the very hut and master Houses? Who was the tenant, the lord and the ruler of this village? What lucky man belonged to this nobleman?

And to the landowner of Tremalakhansky district Andrei Ivanovich Toltetnikov, a young thirty -three -year -old master, a college secretary, an unmarried person.

What kind of person is such, what kind of manner, what properties and what nature was the landowner Andrei Ivanovich Tentetnikov?

Of course, you should ask the neighbors. A neighbor belonging to the surname of retired headquarters, branders expressed a laconic expressive about him: “The natural cattle!” The general, who lived ten miles, said: “A young man, not stupid, but took a lot in his head. I could be useful to him, because I had it in St. Petersburg, and even with ... ”The general did not end with speech. The captain-officer remarked: “Why, Chinka on it is rubbish; But tomorrow I am for him for the arrears! " The man of his village to the question of what kind of master they have, nothing answered. In a word, the public muni about him was rather unfavorable than favorable.

Meanwhile, in his essence, Andrei Ivanovich was either a good or a bad creature, but simply - a smokehouse of heaven. Since there are already a lot in the white world of people smoking the sky, then why not Tentetnikov not smoke it? However, in the few words the whole magazine of his day, and let the reader judge from him, what his character was.

In the morning, he woke up very late and, rising, sat for a long time on his bed, wiping his eyes. The eyes, as if in trouble, were small, and therefore they worthy of their winging unusually long. At all this time, the man Mikhailo with an an sleeve and a towel stood at the door. This poor Mikhailo was an hour, the other, then went to the kitchen, then came again - Barin still rubbed his eyes and sat on the bed. Finally, he rose from bed, washed, put on a bathrobe and went out into the living room, then to drink tea, coffee, cocoa and even fresh milk, sipping a little by all, breaking bread ruthlessly and sparing the tubular ash everywhere unscrupulously. He spent two hours over tea; This is not enough: he took a cold cup and with it moved to the window facing the yard. The next time the next time took place by the window.

First of all, the unshaven buffet Gregory roared, belonging to the perfilieval, a keychain, in these expressions:

- You are a small man, insignificance is a sort of insignificance! You would, a vile woman, be silent, and nothing more.

“I don’t obey you, an insatiable throat!” - shouted nullity, or Perfilievna.

“Why, no one will get along with you, because you will cling to the clerk, you are an Ambaric trifle!” - roared Gregory.

- Yes, and the clerk - the thief is the same as you! - shouted the insignificance so that it was heard in the village. - You are both drinking, destroyers of the Lord, bottomless barrels! Do you think the master does not know you? After all, he is here, because he hears you.

- Where is the master?

- Yes, here he is sitting by the window; He sees everything.

And for sure, the master sat by the window and saw everything.

To the top of this, screamed screaming a yard child, who received a crack from his mother; The male screeching by the greyhound, crouching back to the ground, about the hot boiling water, with which he was running out of the kitchen, a cook. In a word, everything voted and spinning unbearably. Barin saw and heard everything. And only when this was done to such an extent that he even prevented the master from doing anything, he sent him to say that he was noisy.

Two hours before lunch, Andrei Ivanovich went to his office, then to do and really. The lesson was, for sure, the Suria. It consisted in the pondering of an essay, which has already long been thought out. This composition was supposed to hug the whole of Russia from all points - from civil, political, religious, philosophical, to solve the difficult tasks and questions asked by the time, and to determine the very great future - in a word, a large volume. But as long as everything ended with one thought; The feather was hooked, drawings were on paper, and then all this was pushed to the side, a book was taken into the hands of it and was no longer released until dinner. This book was read along with soup, sauce, hot and even with cake, so other dishes were condemned, while others were accepted completely untouched. Then followed the sip of a cup of coffee with a pipe, then a game of chess with himself. What was done later until dinner - right, is already difficult to say. It seems that nothing was done.

And this one spent time, one-single one in general <MIR>, [90] a young thirty-twenty-year-old man, Syden Sydney, in a dressing gown, without a tie. He did not walk, did not go, did not even want to go upward to look at remoteness and views, I didn’t even want to dissolve the windows then to pick up fresh air into the room, and the beautiful view of the village, which no visitor could indifferently admired, certainly did not exist for himself The owner.

From this magazine, the reader can see that Andrei Ivanovich Tentetnikov belonged to the family of those people who are many in Rus', who are names - the names of the awes, the lezyboka, baibaki and the like.

Whether such characters are already born by themselves or are created later, how to answer it. I think that it is better to tell the story of childhood and upbringing Andrei Ivanovich instead of an answer.

As a child, he was a witty, talented boy, then alive, then thoughtful. A happy or unhappy case, he ended up in a school where he was a director, unusual, despite some quirks. Alexander Petrovich had a gift to hear the nature of the Russian man and knew the language that we need to speak with him. None of the children left him with a hanging nose; On the contrary, even after the strictest reprimand, he felt some kind of vigor and the desire to make amends for the trick and misconduct. A crowd of pupils seemed so playful, disrespect and alive that another would take her for an erratic, unbridled freemen. But he would be deceived: the power of one was too heard in this freemen. There was no prankster and shalun, who would not come to him himself and did not tell everything that he did not. The slightest movement of their thoughts was known to him. He acted unusually in everything. He said that, first of all, it should be awakened in a man of ambitious man, - he called the ambitious man a power pushing ahead of a person - without which you will not move him to activities. He could not keep many of the brows and pranks at all: in the original edges he saw the beginning of the vastness of the properties of the mental. He needed them then to see what exactly is lurking in the child. So the smart doctor calmly looks at the emerging temporary seizures and rash, appearing on the body, does not exterminate them, but peers carefully in order to recognize it reliably what exactly is concluded inside a person.

He had few teachers: he read most of the sciences. And I must tell the truth that, without any pedantic terms, huge views and views that young professors like to jam, he knew how to convey the soul of science in a few words, so it was obvious to the young one what exactly he needed, science. He argued that the science of life is more necessary for a person, that, having learned it, he will learn then himself, which should do more predominantly.

He made this science of life the subject of a separate course of education, which entered only the most excellent ones. He issued the low -consuming service from the first year, arguing that they did not need to torment them a lot: enough from them, if they were accustomed to be patient, working performers, without acquiring arrogance and all kinds of species into the distance. “But with wise men, but with the gifts I need to tinker for a long time,” he said usually. And in this course, Alexander Petrovich became completely different and from the first time he announced that he had hitherto he demanded a simple mind from them, now he would demand the mind of the highest. It’s not the mind who knows how to trim the fool and laugh, but knows how to endure any insult, to lower the fool - and not be annoyed. Here he began to demand that others demand from children. This was what he called the highest degree of mind. To preserve in the middle of any grief, a high peace, in which a person should always stay, is what he called with his mind! In this course, Alexander Petrovich showed that he knows, for sure, the science of life. Of the sciences, only those that are able to form a citizen of the land from a person were chosen. Most of the lectures consisted in the stories about what awaits a person in front of all the fields and steps of public service and private exercises. All the griefs and obstacles that are only erected to man in his path, all the temptations and temptations that were coming to him, he gathered in front of them in all nudity, without hiding anything. Everything was known to him, exactly how he himself was trapped in all the titles and positions. In a word, he drew in front of them not at all a rainbow future. Strange affair! Is it because ambition has already been so excited in them; Is it because in the very eyes of an unusual mentor there was something speaking young man: go ahead! - This is a word producing such miracles over a Russian man, or another, but the young man from the very beginning was looking for only difficulties, Alcha act only where it was difficult, where it was necessary to show the most power of the soul. There was something sober in their life. Alexander Petrovich did all sorts of experiments and samples with them, inflicted on them <M.> Sensitive insults, then through their comrades, but, having penetrated this, they became more careful. A little came out of this course, but these few were strong, people were smoked by gunpowder. In the service, they resisted in the most shaky places, while many, much of their smartest, without enduring, abandoned the service because of petty personal troubles, abandoned at all or, without knowing anything, found themselves in the hands of bribe takers and rogues. But the educated by Alexander Petrovich not only did not shake, but, wise by the cognition of man and souls, had a high moral influence even on bribe takers and bad people.

But this learning failed to try to poor Andrei Ivanovich. He was just awarded the transfer to this highest course as one of the best - suddenly misfortune: an extraordinary mentor, whom one approving word has already thrown him into a sweet thrill, died suddenly. Everything changed to the school: some Fedor Ivanovich, a kind and diligent man, entered the place of Alexander Petrovich, but a completely different view of things. In the free casual of children of the first year, something unbridled to him seemed to him. He began to start some external orders between them, demanded that the young people stay in some silent silence, so that in no case did everyone go, as if in pairs. Even the arshin himself began to size the distance from a couple to a couple. At the table, for the best appearance, he planted everyone in height, and not in the mind, so the donkey got the best pieces, smart ones - fireplace. All this made a murmur, especially when the new boss, just like a contrary to his suburbs, announced that for him the mind and good successes in the sciences mean nothing, that he was looking only at the behavior, that if a person studies poorly, but behaves well, but he behaves well, He will prefer him to be wise. But it was precisely to that that Fedor Ivanovich did not receive, which he sought. The pranks are hidden, which, as you know, are worse than the open ones. Everything was in a string during the day, and at night - jackpot.

In the image of teaching sciences, he turned everything upside down. With the most good intentions, he started all kinds of innovations - and all out of place. I wrote out new teachers, with new views and new points of views. They read the scientist, threw the listeners with many new terms and words. A logical connection was visible, and followed by new discoveries, but alas! There was no life in science itself. All this began to seem dead in the eyes of those who began to understand the audience. Everything went in advance. But the worst of all was that the respect for the authorities and the authorities was lost: they began to mock both mentors and teachers, the director began to be called Fedka, the Bulk and other different names; There were such things that many had to be turned off and expelled.

Andrei Ivanovich was a quiet one. He did not participate in night orgies with his comrades, who, despite the strictest supervision, brought his mistress on the side-one by eight people-not also in other pranks that reached sacrilement and ridicule of religion himself because the director only demanded Frequent went to church and a bad priest came across. But he hung his nose. The ambitious was excited in it, and he was not of activity and field. It would be better not to excite him! He listened to the professors who were hot at the department, and recalled the former mentor who, without exciting, knew how to speak clearly. He listened to chemistry and philosophy of rights, and professorship deepening into all the subtleties of the political sciences, and the universal history of mankind in such a huge form that the professor at the age of three managed to only read the introduction and the development of communities of some German cities; But all this remained in his head with some ugly shreds. Thanks to the natural mind, he only felt that he should not be taught, but he did not know. And he often remembered Alexander Petrovich, and so he was sad that he did not know where to go from longing.

But youth have a future. As time was approaching the release, his heart was beating. He said to himself: “After all, this is not life, it is only a preparation for life: a real life in the service. There are exploits. " And, not looking at the beautiful corner, so striking the guest-to the guest, without bowing to the dust of his parents, according to the custom of all the ambitious people he rushed to St. Petersburg, where, as you know, our dusty youth seeks to serve, shine, to see themselves, to seek out, or to seek out, or to see Just grab the tops of colorless, cold as ice, public deceptive education. Andrei Ivanovich’s ambitious desire was besieged, however, from the very beginning his uncle, the actual state adviser Onufry Ivanovich. He announced that the main thing is in good handwriting, and not in anything else, that without this you will not fall into the ministers or state advisers, and Tentetnikov wrote to the same letter, about which they said: “I wrote forty paws, and not a human".

With great difficulty and with the help of uncles, having spent two months in calligraphic lessons, he finally took out the place of papers in some department. When he ascended the bright hall, where writers of the gentlemen, noise with feathers and his head to the side, were sitting everywhere at written varnished tables, and when they put him himself, suggesting that he immediately rewrite some paper, an unusually strange feeling penetrated him. It seemed to him for a while how he would find himself in some kind of young school, then, in order to study the alphabet, as if they were transferred from the upper class to Nizhny. Sitting around His Lord seemed to him so similar to the disciples. Other of them read a novel, putting it in large sheets of the work they have been analyzed, as if they were engaged in the very thing, and at the same time trembling with any appearance of the boss. He suddenly introduced himself, as a non-returning-lost paradise, his school time. So suddenly became high by taking the learning before this petty written occupation. How this training preparation for the service seemed to him now above the service itself. And suddenly he appeared in his thoughts, like a living, not compared with anyone, a wonderful educator, not a replaceable Alexander Petrovich with anyone, and suddenly tears flowed out of his eyes in three streams. The room was dizzy, the tables were pushed, the officials mixed, and he almost fell from instant darkening. “No,” he said in himself, waking up, “I’ll take up the matter, no matter how small it seemed small at first!” Fucked by spirit and heart, he decided to serve following the example of others.

Where are there no pleasure? They live in St. Petersburg, despite the harsh, gloomy appearance. A angry thirty-degree frost is cracking through the streets, screeches a desperate demon Witch-Voyug, sinking on the head the collars of fur coats and overcoats, a powder of the mustache and muzzle of cattle, but the window shines at the top somewhere, even on the fourth floor; In a cozy room, with modest stearin candles, under the noise of the samovar, a warming and heart is a conversation, a bright page of the inspired Russian poet is being conducted, which God rewarded with his Russia, and so sublimely, the young heart of the young man trembles, as it does not happen nowhere in others lands and under the midday luxurious sky.

Soon, Tentetnikov got used to the service, but only it did not the first thing and the goal, as he believed at the beginning, but something second. She served him as a distribution of time, forcing him to cherish the remaining minutes more. The uncle, the actual state adviser, was already beginning to think that in his nephew there would be a hing, when suddenly his nephew was guessed. It must be said that among the friends of Andrei Ivanovich there were two people who were called upset people. These were those restless characters that could not endure indifferently not only injustices, but even all that seems in their eyes injustice. Good at first, but randomly themselves in their actions, they are executed into intolerance to others. The ardent speech of them and the noble image of indignation affected him strongly. Having woken up the nerves and the spirit of irritability in him, they forced to notice all the little things that he had not thought to pay attention to. Fedor Fedorovich Lenitsyn, the head of the department in which he was listed, a man of the most comprehensive appearance, suddenly did not like it. He began to look for the abyss of shortcomings in him and hated him because he expressed a lot of sugar in his face when he spoke with the Higher, and then, turning to the lower, all vinegar became. “I would forgive him,” said Tentnikov, “if this change did not happen so soon in his face; But as right there, with my eyes, and sugar and vinegar at the same time! ” Since then, he began to notice every step. It seemed to him that Fyodor Fedorovich was already important, that he had all the manners of small bosses, somehow: to take on the remark of those who did not appear on him on the holidays, even to take revenge on all those who were not the names of the Swiss on a sheet, and many different sinful accessories, without which neither a good nor an evil person does not. He felt his unmisters disgust. Some evil spirit pushed him to do something unpleasant to Fedor Fedorovich. He nailed to this with some special pleasure and managed to. Once he talked to him so largely that he was announced from his superiors - either asking for an apology or resigning. He resigned. The uncle, the actual state adviser, came to him frightened and implored.

- For the sake of Christ himself! Have mercy, Andrey Ivanovich, what are you doing! Leaving the started quarry so profitably because the boss came across the wrong one ... what is it? After all, if you look at it, then no one would have left in the service. Found, form. There is still time! Rinse pride and self -love, go and explain with him!

“It's not the point, uncle,” said the nephew. “It’s not difficult for me to ask him for an apology, especially since I, for sure, is to blame.” He is my boss, and in no case I should have said so with him. But the thing is: you have forgotten that I have another service; I have three hundred souls of the peasants, the estate in the disorder, and the manager is a fool. The state of loss is a little if instead of me it comes to the office of another to rewrite paper, but a big loss, if three hundred people do not pay taxes. I am the landowner: the title is also not idle. If I take care of the preservation, savings and improvement of the fate of the people entrusted to me and present the state three hundred and strong, sober, working subjects-why will my service be worse than the service of some head of the Lenitsyn branch?

The actual state adviser remained with an open mouth from amazement. He did not expect such a stream of words. Thinking a little, he began in this way:

“But still ... but how can it be ... how to sank yourself in the village?” What society can be between a peasant? Here, nevertheless, the general or prince will meet on the street. If you want, and you yourself will pass by some public beautiful buildings, you’ll go to look at the Neva, but there, whatever comes across, all this is either a man or a woman. For what to condemn yourself to ignorance for your life?

So said the uncle, the actual state adviser. He himself did not go his lifetime along another street, except for the one that led to the place of his service, where there were no public beautiful buildings; He did not notice any of the oncoming people whether he was a general or prince; I did not know the whims in the eyes who teased people who are floating in the capitals of people in the capitals, and he was not even in theater in the theater. He said all this only then to rub the ambitious and act on the imagination of a young man. In this, however, he did not have time: Tentetnikov stood on his stubbornly. Departments and the capital began to bother him. The village began to introduce herself to some kind of a soil shelter, the spinning rod of thoughts and thoughts, the only pickup of useful activity. About two weeks after this conversation, he was already in the vicinity of the places where his childhood flashed. How everything became remembered, how the heart was clogged in him when he felt that he was already near his father’s village! He had already forgotten many places at all and looked curiously, like a beginner, at beautiful views. When the road rushed through a narrow ravine into the thicket of a huge stalled forest and he saw three hundred -year -old oaks above himself and under him, three people into a girth, interspersed with a fir, elm and sedge, growing the top of the poplar, and when to the question: “whose forest is whose forest ? " - They said to him: “Tentetnikov”; When, getting out of the forest, the road with meadows rushed, past aspen groves, young and old willow and vines, in view of the elevations stretching in the distance, and flew the same river with bridges in different places, leaving it to the right or left of itself, and When to the question: "Whose meadows and baking places?" - answered him: "Tentetnikov"; когда поднялась потом дорога на гору и пошла по ровной возвышенности с одной стороны мимо неснятых хлебов: пшеницы, ржи и ячменя, с другой же стороны мимо всех прежде проеханных им мест, которые все вдруг показались в картинном отдалении, и когда, постепенно темнея, входила And then the road came to the shadow of wide, developing trees that stirred up the scattering along the green carpet to the village itself, and the brick huts of men and the Lord's buildings covered with red roofs flashed; When the gap in and without a question, Kuda arrived, the feeling, the feeling, constantly accumulating, finally erupted with almost the following words: “Well, wasn't I a fool? Fate appointed me to be the owner of an earthly paradise, a prince, and I hardened myself in the office with a scribe! Having studied, having educated, having shifted, having made a decent reserve of the information that is required to manage people, improve the whole area, to fulfill the diverse duties of the landowner, who is both the judge, the manager and the guardian of order, to entrust this place to the ignorant! And to choose instead what? - Re -writing of papers, which can incomparably better produce a cantonist who has not studied anything! ” And once again he gave himself the name of the fool Andrei Ivanovich Tentetnikov.

Meanwhile, another sight awaited him. Having learned about the arrival of the master, the population of the whole village gathered to the porch. Colorful shawls, dressings, sweatshirts, zipuna, beards of all genera: with a standings, a shovel and a wedge, red, blond and white, like silver, covered the entire area. The men thundered: "The breadwinner, we waited for you!" The women were slaughtered: "Gold, silver you are cordial!" The standing fed even fought from diligence to get away. A flabby old woman, similar to a dried pear, swayed between the legs of others, approached him, threw up her hands and screeched: “You are our snot, but what a liquid! The cursed Nemchura riveted you! " - “You went, Baba! - shouted to her immediately beards with a standings, a shovel and a wedge. - You go out, clumsy! ” Someone loved such a word to this, from which the Russian man alone could not laugh. Barin could not stand it and laughed, but nevertheless he was touched deeply in his soul. “So much love! And for what? He thought in himself. - For the fact that I have never seen them, I never dealt with them! From now on, I give the word to divide the labors with you and occupying yours! I will use everything to help you find what you should be, what your good one has to be, your prisoner is your own nature, so that your love is not for nothing, so that I, for sure, be your breadwinner! ”

Indeed, Tentetnikov did not jokingly began to host and dispose. He saw on the spot that the clerk was a woman and a fool with all the qualities of a crafted clerk, that is, he carefully led the count of chickens and eggs, yarns and canvases brought by women, but did not know the Belmas of harvesting bread and crops, and suspected the addition to everything The men in the attempt on their lives. He kicked out the fool of the clerk, he chose another, briskly. He left the little things, paid attention to the main parts, reduced the corvee, reduced the days of work on himself, added time to the peasants to work for themselves and thought that now things would go the most decent order. He himself began to enter everything, to appear in the fields, on the threshing floor, in the ivins, on the mills, by the pier, with the load and rafting of bares and flat -bottomed.

"Yes, you, you, you, the military!" - The men began to speak and even scratch in the heads, because from long -term label management they were all pretty fledged. But this did not last long. The Russian man is scurrying away and smart: he soon understood that the master, though a stem, is a hunt in him to take up a lot, but how exactly, how to take it-he doesn’t understand this yet, he says somehow too competently and intricately, the peasant is not inhabited And not in science. It turned out that the master and man somehow did not understand each other at all, but simply did not sang together, did not adapt to withdraw the same note. Tentetnikov began to notice that on the Lord land everything came out somehow worse than on a peasant: it was sown earlier, it rose later. And they worked, it seemed good: he himself was present and ordered to give even to the chapoi vodka for hard work. The peasants had a long time for rye, oats spilled out and the millet bought, and he barely began to only go into the pipe, the heel of the spike was not yet tied. In a word, he began to notice the master that the man was simply wandering, despite all the benefits. I tried to reproach, but I received such an answer: “How can I, the master, so that we are about the Lord, that is, the benefit is not glad? They themselves deigned to see how they tried when they plowed and sowed: they ordered the vodka to be served. ” What was to object to it? "Why is it bad now?" - interrogated the master. "Who knows! Apparently, the worm climbed from below, and summer, you see, what: there were no rains at all. ” But Barin saw that the men had not eaten down from below, and the rain was somehow strange, a strip: he landed, and at least dropped a drop to the bar's field. It was even more difficult for him to get along with the women. Every now and then they asked for work, complaining about the burden of corvee. Strange affair! He destroyed all sorts of canvases, berries, mushrooms and nuts completely, half reduced other works from them, thinking that the women would turn this time on the household, widen, put their husbands, multiply the gardens. It wasn't there! Focus, fight, gossip and all sorts of quarrels have started between the beautiful floor such that the husbands now and then came to him with the following words: “Barin, gone the demon-buba! Exactly what the hell! There is no life from her! " Several times, relieving his heart, he wanted to take severity. But how to be strict? Baba came with such a woman, so developed, such a hill, sick, so bad, ugly stole rags - where she gained them, God's news. "Go, step only out of my eyes, God be with you!" -Poor Tentatnikov said and after that he had the pleasure of seeing the patient, going out of the gate, grabbed with a neighbor for some turnip and broke off her sides, as a healthy man would not be able to. He decided to try some kind of school between them, but this had such nonsense that he hung his head-it was better not to think! All this significantly cooled his zeal to both the household, and to the proceeding judicial case, and in general to activity. During work, he was already present almost without attention: thoughts were far away, his eyes were looking for extraneous objects. During the mowing, he did not look at the fast rise of sixty at once and a measured one with a light noise under them in rows of high grass; Instead, he looked at some kind of an uppers of the river, along the banks of which the red-bearing, red-bearing Martyn walked-of course, a bird, not a man; He watched this Martyn, catching the fish, holding it in the nose, as if thinking, swallowed or not to swallow, and at the same time, the river was intently hired, where another Martyn, who had not yet caught fish, but looked in the distance, was visible in the distance Close up to Martyn, who had already caught fish. During the harvesting of bread, he did not look at how the sheaves were stacked with shocks, crosses, and sometimes just a width. He did not care whether the stacks were lazily or very well and laid them. Having closed his eyes and raising his head up, to the heavenly spaces, he left smell of fields to smell of fields, and hearing - to be affected by the voices of the air melodious population, when it is from everywhere, from heaven and from the ground, it connects into one sound mocking choir, not polling each other. The quail beats, twitching the dergun in the grass, rumbling and chiling the flying hemp, trills of the larks are poured along the invisible air staircase, and the turbulence turbidity rushing as side with the string of silver pipes, the void is heard in the void of the shameful air desert. Whether work was carried out near - it was far from it; Whether she was in the distance - his eyes were found, which was closer. And he looked like that multiple student who looks at the book, but at the same time sees the figure substituted to him by a comrade. Finally, he completely stopped going to work, threw a court completely, and all sorts of reprisals, settled in the rooms and stopped taking it to himself even with the reports of the clerk.

At times from the neighbors, he would turn to him, it used to be a retired hussar-bug, smoking through a pipe chicken, or a colonel brander, master and a conversation hunter about everything. But even this began to bother him. Their conversations began to seem somehow superficial to him; Living, dexterous circulation, busts on the knee and other abolitions began to seem too straight and open to him. He decided to get acquainted with them and made it even quite sharply. It was, when the representative of all colonel-branders, the most comprehensive in all superficial conversations about everything, Barbarian Nikolaich Vishnepokromov then came to him precisely to talk plenty, affected politics, philosophy, and morality, and even the fortune in England, He sent to say that he was not at home, and at the same time had the imprudence of appearing in front of the window. The guest and the owner met with eyes. One, of course, grumbled through his teeth: “Cattle!”, The other sent him something like a pig. So the acquaintance ended. Since then, no one has come to him. The solitude of the full was put in the house. The owner climbed into the robe hopelessly, having betrayed the body to inaction, and the thought was thinking about a great compound about Russia. As this composition was pondered, the reader has already seen. The day came and left, monotonous and colorless. This is not to say, however, so that there were no minutes in which he seemed to be awakened by his sleep. When the post of newspapers, new books and magazines brought to him in the press the familiar name of the former comrade, who had already succeeded in the prominent field of public service or brought a feasible tribute to science and universal education, the secret quiet sadness approached him under his heart, and mournful, silently, gym, sorrow. A quiet complaint about its inaction broke out involuntarily. Then his life seemed nasty and nasty to him. With extraordinary power, the school past time was resurrected before him and suddenly appeared, like alive, Alexander Petrovich ... his tears poured from his eyes, and sobbing continued almost the whole day.

What did these sobs mean? Whether they found a sorrowful secret of its illness that a sick soul that a tall inner person began to form in it did not have time to form and get stronger; that, not experienced in the struggle against failures, he did not reach a high fortun to rise and grow stronger from the barriers and obstacles; that, having melted, like a heated metal, a rich supply of great sensations did not accept the last hardening, and now, without elasticity, his will is powerless; That an unusual mentor died too early for him and now there is no one in the world who would be able to erect and raise the weakness of the power staggering with eternal fluctuations and the weak will, who would shout in a lively, awakening voice, ”shouted to the soul an awakening word: forward: go ahead ! - who is longing everywhere, at all steps, a Russian person standing, all estates, titles and crafts?

Where is the one who in the native language of our Russian soul would be able to say this omnipotent word to us: go? Who, knowing all the forces, properties, and the whole depth of our nature, could have rushed to a high life of a Russian man with one sorcerer’s manner? With what words, what love would a grateful Russian man pay him. But the eyelids have passed for centuries; Half a million Sydney, more unclear and baibakov is naps in improperly, and a husband who knows how to pronounce it is rarely born in Rus', this is an omnipotent word.

One circumstance was slightly, however, Tentnikov did not wake up and almost made a coup in his character. Something like love happened, but even here the matter somehow came down to nothing. In the neighborhood, ten miles from his village, a general lived, who responded, as we have already seen, not quite favorable about Tentetnikov. The general lived as a general, grained, loved that the neighbors came to express his respect; Of course, he himself did not pay visits, spoke hoarsely, read books and had a daughter, an unprecedented being, strange, which could soon be honored with some fantastic vision than a woman. Sometimes it happens to a person in a dream to see something like that, and since then he has been dreaming of this dream in his whole life, reality disappears forever, and he is strongly suitable for anything. She had a street name. She brought up somehow strangely. She was raised by the Englishwoman-governess, who did not know a word in Russian. She lost her mother as a child. There was no time for his father. However, loving his daughter to madness, he could only spoil her. It is unusually difficult to depict her portrait. It was something living, like life itself. She was prettier than a beauty; better than smart; Slender, airy classic woman. It could not have been said to which the country put its imprint on it, because it was difficult to find such a profile and outline of the face somewhere, except on ancient cameras. As in a child brought up at large, it was everything wayward. If anyone saw how sudden anger was suddenly collecting strict wrinkles on her beautiful brow and how she argued ardently with her father, he would have thought that it was a moody creature. But anger was with her only when she heard about any injustice or a cruel act with anyone. But when this anger disappeared if she saw in the misfortune of the very one who was angry at, as if she suddenly threw her wallet without thinking whether it was smart or stupid, and tore a dress for dressing on herself if he was injured! There was something swift in her. When she spoke, she seemed to be striving after the thought: the expressions of her face, the expression of the conversation, the movement of the hands, the very folds of the dress seemed to strive in the same direction, and it seemed that she herself would fly away after her own words. There was nothing in her. She would not be afraid to find her thoughts to anyone, and no power could make her be silent when she wanted to speak. Her charming, special, belonging to her alone, the gait was before that carelessly, was, that everything would be inferior to her involuntarily the road. With her, an unkind man was somehow embarrassed and went numb, and the kind, even the most shy, could talk with her, like never in his life with anyone, and-a strange deception! -From the first minutes of the conversation, it already seemed to him that somewhere and once he knew her that it happened in the days of some timeless infancy, in some home, fun in the evening, with joyful games of the children's crowd, and for a long time for a long time After that, somehow the rational age of a person became boring to him.

Andrei Ivanovich Tentetnikov could not tell how this happened that from the very first days he became with her as it would be familiar forever. Inexplicable, a new feeling came to his soul. His boring life was illuminated for a moment. The robe was left for a while. Not so long he dug in the bed, not so long stood Mikhailo with the Aknomnik in his hands. The windows in the rooms were dissolved, and often the owner of the picture estate walked for a long time in the dark bends of his garden and stopped by the clock in front of captivating views for remote.

The general first accepted Tentetnikov quite well and cordially; But they could not completely converge among themselves. Their conversations always ended with a dispute and some kind of unpleasant sensation on both sides. The general did not like opposition and reasons, although at the same time he loved to talk even about what he did not know at all. Totatnikov, for his part, was also a delicate man. However, for the sake of the daughter, much was said to the father, and their world was held until they came to the general of a relative, Countess Boldyrev and Princess Yuzyakin: one - a widow, the old girl, both maids of honor, both chatterboxes, both gossipers. , not very charming courtesy, but, however, having significant connections in St. Petersburg, and before which the general even granted a little. It seemed to Tentetnikov that from the very day of arrival, their general became somehow colder to him, almost did not notice him and treated him as a wordless or an official used for correspondence, the smallest. He told him either his brother or the dear, and even you told him once. Andrei Ivanovich exploded; Blood rushed into his head. Relieved his heart and gritting his teeth, he, however, had the presence of the spirit to say an unusually courteous and soft voice, while the spots performed on his face and everything inside was in full swing:

“I have to thank you, general, for your location.” You invite and call me in a word you are for the most close friendship, obliging you and you also tell you. But let me notice that I remember our difference in years, completely impedes such a familiar appeal between us.

The general was embarrassed. Gathering words and thoughts, he began to say, although it was somewhat incoherent that you were told the word not in the sense that the old man is sometimes allowed to say to the young man (he did not mention a word about his rank).

Of course, since then, the acquaintance between them ceased, and love ended at the very beginning. The light went out, for a minute there was a flashing in front of him, and the twilight that followed him became even more gloomy. Baibak Syaznova climbed into his bathrobe. Everything turned to the lying on the lynch and inaction. The house started muck and disorder. The sex brush remained on the whole day in the middle of the room with Sor. Pantalones even entered the living room. On a dandy table in front of the sofa lay greasy suspenders, like a treat to a guest, and before that his life became insignificant and sleepy that not only his yard people stopped respecting, but even almost pecked domestic hens. He was powerlessly drawing on paper for a whole hour of the Rogulka, houses, huts, carts, three or wrote out "Gracious sovereign!" With an exclamation mark of all handwriting and characters. And sometimes, having forgotten everything, the pen was drawing by itself, without the knowledge of the owner, a small head with thin, sharp features, with a raised light strand of hair that fell from under the rowing with long thin curls, young bare hands, as if flying, and in The owner saw the amazement how the portrait of the one with which the portrait could not write any painter came out. And even more sadly he became him later, and, believing that there was no happiness on Earth, he remained boring and unrequited for the whole day.

These were the circumstances of Andrei Ivanovich Tentnikov. Suddenly, one day, approaching the window in the usual order, with a tube and a cup in his hands, he noticed a movement and some vanity in the courtyard. The boots and breakdowns ran to open the gates, and horses appeared in the gate, exactly how they sculpt or draw them on the triumphal gates: muzzle to the right, muzzle to the left, muzzle in the middle. Out of them, on the goats - a coachman and a footman in a wide frock coat, surrounding himself with a handkerchief. Behind them, the gentleman is in the cap and overcoats, wrapped in a scarf of rainbow flowers. When the crew diverted in front of the porch, it turned out that he was nothing else, like a spring light brichka. The master of unusually decent appearance jumped onto the porch with the speed and dexterity of almost a military man.

Andrey Ivanovich scared. He took him as an official from the government. It must be said that in his youth, he was imposed in one unreasonable business. Some philosophers from the hussars, and the unfinished student, and the squandered player started some philanthropic society, under the supreme disposal of the old plut, and the mason, and the card player, the drunkard and the eloquent person. Society was arranged in order to deliver strong happiness to all humanity from the banks of Thames to Kamchatka. The cash desk of money was required a huge one, incredible donations gathered from the generous members. Where all this went - only one supreme manager knew about this. Two friends who belonged to the class of upset people, kind people, were tightened into society, but who, from frequent toasts in the name of science, enlightenment and progress, later became formal drunkards. Tentetnikov soon caught himself and dropped out of this circle. But society had already managed to get confused in some other actions, not even decent nobleman, so then things started with the police ... And therefore it was not surprising that although they had come out and tear all sorts of intercourse with the benefactor of mankind, he could not, however. the same, remain obstructed. On his conscience, he was not quite clever. He looked not without fear and now at the dissolved door.

His fear, however, suddenly passed when the guest bowed with the dexterity of incredible, maintaining a respectful position of his head a little to one side. In short, but definitive words, he explained that he has already been traveling around Russia, prompted by both needs and curiosity; that our state is removing remarkable objects, not to mention the beauty of places, abundance of fishing and a variety of soils; that he was carried away by the picture of the location of his village; that, however, however, to the picture of the location, he would not dare to concern him in an inappropriate arrival if something had not happened in his brown, requiring the hands of help from blacksmiths and masters; What for all that, however, if nothing had happened in his Brick, he could not have denied himself the pleasure of testifying his respect for him personally.

Having graduated, the guest with a charming pleasantness snapped his leg and, despite the fullness of the case, jumped right there a little back with the ease of the rubber ball.

Andrei Ivanovich thought that this should be some inquisitive professor scientist who drives Russia then to collect some plants or even fossil objects. He expressed him all his readiness to argue; He proposed his masters, Kolesnikov and blacksmiths to amend the Brichka; I asked him to sit in him as in his own house; He seated the courteous guest in the large Voltaire "chairs" and prepared to listen to his story, without a doubt, about scientific objects and natural ones.

The guest, however, touched the more events of the inner world. Spoke about the vicissitudes of fate; Awaked the life of his ship in the middle of the seas driving from everywhere by winds; He mentioned that he had to change many places and posts that he had suffered a lot for the truth, that even his very life was more than once in the danger of enemies, and he told a lot of things from which Tentatnikov could see that his guest was Rather, a practical person. In the conclusion of everything, he was fading into the White Batista scarf as loudly as Andrei Ivanovich did not even hear. Sometimes in the orchestra such a rogue-pipe, which, when enough, it seems that it was grunted not in the orchestra, but in his own ear. Exactly the same sound was heard in the awakened chambers of a dozing house, and immediately after it was followed by the fragrance of the cologne, invisibly widespread dexterous to shake the nasal batista scarf.

The reader, perhaps, had already guessed that the guest was not the other who, like our venerable, for a long time left by Pavel Ivanovich Chichikov. He became a little old: as you can see, this time was not without storms and anxieties. It seemed that the very tailcoat on it was a little a little, and a Brichka, and a coachman, a servant, and horses, and the harness seemed to have been ate and faded. It seemed that, as if the finances were not in an enviable state. But the expressions of the face, the decent, the circumvention remained the same. Even as if even more pleasant, he became in actions and turns, he even deftly put a leg under his leg when he sat down in his chair; There was even more softness in the reprimand of speeches, cautious moderation in words and expressions, more skillful to keep itself and more than a tact in everything. Beliy and cleaner of snow were on him collars and a shirt, and despite the fact that he was from the road, no fluffy sat down on a tailcoat, at least at a birthday lunch! The cheeks and chin were shaved so that one unless the blind could not admire the pleasant convexity and round them.

There was a transformation in the house. Half of him, who was until the blindness, with stabbed shutters, suddenly insight and illuminated. They began to make a luggage from Brichka. Everything began to be placed in the illuminated rooms, and soon everything took this appearance: a room, determined to be a bedroom, contained the things necessary for the night toilet; A room determined to be a cabinet ... But first you need to know that there were three tables in this room: one written - in front of the sofa, the other is the lomber - between the windows by the wall, the third coal is in the corner, between the door to the bedroom and the door to the uninhabited hall with a wheelchair furniture. On this coal table, a dress taken out of a suitcase was placed, namely: pantalones for a tailcoat, trousers for a frock coat, gray pantalos, two velvet vests and two satin, a frock coat and two tailcoats. (The vests of the white peak and summer trousers moved to the linen in the chest of drawers.) All this was located alone on another pyramid and covered with a hand -like silk scarf on top. In another corner, between the door and the window, boots lined up in a row: the boots are not entirely new, the boots are completely new, boots with new heads and varnished half -boots. They were also shamefully curtained by a silk handkerchief - so that they were not there at all. On the table in front of two windows, a box fit. On the desk in front of the sofa is a portfolio, a bank with cologne, wax, toothbrushes, a new calendar and two of some novels, both second volumes. Clean linen fit in a chest of drawers already in the bedroom; The laundry, which was followed by the laundry, was tied to the knot and slipped under the bed. The suitcase, according to his processing, was also slipped under the bed. The saber also fit in the bedroom, hanging on a nail not far from the bed. The one and the other room took the form of purity and neatness of the extraordinary. Nowhere is a piece of paper, no feather, no sorcini. The very air somehow ennobled. It established a pleasant smell of a healthy, fresh man who does not cure linen, goes to the bathhouse and wipes himself with a wet sponge on Sundays. In the vestibule room, the smell of a parsley minister was attempted to establish for a while, but Parsley was soon moved to the kitchen, as it followed.

In the early days, Andrei Ivanovich was afraid for his independence so that he would not somehow bound him, did not constrain with some change in lifestyle, and the order of his day, so successfully opened-but the fears were in vain. Pavel Ivanovich showed an unusually flexible ability to adapt to everything. He approved the philosophical leisureness of the owner, saying that she promises a centenary life. He expressed himself very happily about solitude - namely, that it feeds great thoughts in man. Looking at the library and responding with praise about books in general, he noticed that they were saving from the idleness of a person. In a word, I dropped the words, but significant. In his actions, he acted even more by the way. He was in time, left in time; did not make the owner difficult in requests during his negligence hours; I was happy to play chess with him, he was happy to be silent. At a time when one launched pipe smoke with curly clouds, the other, not smoking a tube, invented, however, the lesson corresponded to that: he took out, for example, from a silver pocket with a black fellow and, confirming it between the two fingers of his left hand, turned it quickly With the right finger, in such a way as the earthly sphere turns near its axis, or just drummed on tobacker with his fingers, whistling some kind of one or one. In a word, he did not interfere with the owner in any way. “This is the first time I see a person with whom you can live,” Tentetnikov said to himself. - In general, we have little this art. There are enough people between us and smart, and kind, but people constantly pleasant, people constantly even, people with whom you can live a century and not quarrel - I do not know how much we can find such people! Here is the first, only person I see! " So Tentetnikov responded about his guest.

Chichikov, for his part, was very glad that he had settled for a while with such a peaceful and humble owner. He was tired of gypsy life. It was useful for a month, in a beautiful village, in a beautiful village, in view of the fields and the beginning of spring, it was even useful in hemorrhoidal terms. It was difficult to find the best corner for resting. Spring removed him with the beauty of unspeakable. What a brightness in greenery! What freshness in the air! What a bird scream in the gardens! Paradise, joy and glee of everything! The village sounded and sang, as if a newborn.

Chichikov walked a lot. Then he directed his walk along the flat peak of elevations, in view of the valleys spreading below, along which even larger lakes remained from the spill of water everywhere; or entered the ravines, where the woods barely beginning to clean the leaves are aggravated by bird nests, stunned by the croaking of the raven, with conversations of galks and brots' brots, cross -fussing, darming up the sky; Or he went down to the muddy places and torn dams - to look at how water rushed to turn into the mill wheels with a deafening noise; or made his way to Dala to the pier, from where they rushed, along with the flow of water, the first vessels, loaded with peas, oats, barley and wheat; Or he went to the fields for the first spring work to look at how fresh orange passed through the greenery with a black strip, or as a clever sower threw seeds from a handful, aptly, not passing the grain to one or the other side. He interpreted and spoke with the clerk, and with a man and a miller - and what, and how, and what crops can be expected, and what way they have a smell, and how much bread is sold, and what they choose in the spring and autumn for the torment And what is the name of every man, and who with whom is related, and where he bought a cow, and how he feeds a pig - in a word, that's all. I also learned how many men were free. It turned out a little. As a smart person, he suddenly noticed that Andrei Ivanovich was unenviable. Everywhere in the passage, negligence, theft, a lot and drunkenness. And he mentally said in himself: “What, however, the cattle of the tendeters! Launch the estate that could bring to a small extent fifty thousand annual income! ” And, not being able to keep fair indignation, he repeated: "Resolutely cattle!" More than once in the middle of such walks it came to the idea of ​​someday to become himself-that is, of course, not now, but after, when the main thing will be done and there will be funds in his hands-to become the most peaceful owner of such an estate. Then the young mistress seemed to him, fresh, white -leafing woman, maybe even from the merchant class, however, however, educated and educated as a noblewoman, so that she understands music, although, of course, music and not the main thing, but not the main thing, but not the main thing, but Why, if it has already been started, why go against a common opinion against it? The younger generation, who was supposed to perpetuate him to perpetuate the surname of the Chichikovs: a Reveunchik boy and beauty daughter, or even two boys, two or even three girls, so that everyone knows that he really lived and existed, and not only went along the ground. Shadow or ghost - so that it is not ashamed to the fatherland. It even seemed to him that some addition would be not much to the rank: the state adviser, for example, the rank of respectable and respectful ... And it occurred to him a lot that it so often takes a person from a boring present moment, teases, teases, moves him and happens to him and happens To him, even when he is sure, he himself will never come true.

The people of Pavel Ivanovich also liked the village. They, like him, settled in it. Parsley came down very soon with the barrier Gregory, although at first they both important and sulked in before each other unbearably. Petrushka let Gregory dust in the eyes that he was in Kostroma, Yaroslavl, Nizhny and even in Moscow; Gregory besieged him immediately to Petersburg, in which Petrushka was not. The latter wanted to rise and leave at the distance of the distances of the places in which he visited; But Gregory called him such a place that could not be found on any map, and counted thirty thousand with a milestone, so the parsley spun, opened his mouth and was raised to laugh right away. However, the case ended between them the closest friendship: his uncle bald Pimen held at the end of the village the famous tavern, to which the name was “Shark”; In this institution they saw all the hours of the day. There they became their friends, or what they call the people - the Kabatsky regulators.

Selifan had a different kind of bait. In the village, no evening, the songs were sung, spring round dances were braided and plunged. Porny, slender girls, which were difficult to find in another place, forced him to stand a sheep for several hours. It was hard to say, which is better: all the white -breasted, white -haired, everyone's eyes have a turnip, everyone's eyes with a lump, a passage with a peacock and a braid to the waist. When, holding his hands with both hands, he slowly moved with them in a round dance or extended to them with a wall, in a series of other guys and faded a hotly rising evening, and quietly faded around the highlander, and a daler of the river was given a faithful eruption of an invariably sad tungeon, - He did not know then what was done to him. For a long time in a dream and in reality, in the morning and at dusk, it all seemed to him that in both hands his white hands and he was moving with them in a round dance. Waving his hand, he said: "Damned girls!"

Chichikov’s horses also liked a new home. And the indigenous and attached Kaura of the suit, called the assessor, and the most sensitive, about which Selifan was expressed: “scoundrel-loshad”, found the stay of Tentenikov completely non-core, the oats are excellent, and the location of the stables is unusually convenient. Every stall, although fenced off, could see other horses through the partitions, so if one of them came to one of them, even the most distant, the fantasy suddenly rustle, then he could answer the same hour.

In a word, everyone has settled down at home. The reader may be amazed that Chichikov did not hint at the part of famous souls. No matter how! Pavel Ivanovich became very careful about this subject. If I even had to deal with the fools round, he would not suddenly began. The Tentetnikov, be that as it may, reads books, philosophizes, tries to explain all the reasons for everything - and why, and why ... “No, take it! Is it to start from the other end? " - Thus thought Chichikov. Having often got off the courtyards, by the way, he explored from them that the Barin went before rather often to the general’s neighbor, that General Baryshny, that the Barin was to the young lady, and the young lady was also to the master ... but then suddenly for something for something for something for something They did not get along and parted. He noticed himself that Andrei Ivanovich painted some heads with a pencil and pen, one to another similar. Once after lunch, wrapping, as usual, a silver snuffbox around its axis, he said like this:

- You have everything, Andrei Ivanovich; One thing is lacking.

- What? He asked, releasing curled smoke.

“Friends of life,” said Chichikov.

Andrei Ivanovich said nothing. The conversation ended.

Chichikov was not embarrassed, he chose another time, already before dinner, and, talking about that and this, he suddenly said:

- And right, Andrei Ivanovich, it would not hurt you to marry.

If only the word said to this tender, just like that the very question was about this to him unpleasant.

Chichikov was not embarrassed. For the third time he chose time, after dinner, and said this:

-But still, no matter how you turn your circumstances, I see that you need to marry: you will fall into hypochondria.

Whether the words of Chichikov were so convincing this time, or the location of the spirit of Andrei Ivanovich was somehow especially configured for frankness-he sighed and said, putting up a tubular smoke: “Everything must be born lucky, Pavel Ivanovich,” and Pavel Ivanovich, ”and Pavel Ivanovich,” and Pavel Ivanovich, ”and Pavel Ivanovich,” and He told everything, as it was, the whole story of acquaintance with the general and the gap.

When I heard Chichikov, from word to word, I saw the whole thing that because of one word you had such a story, he was dumbfounded. For several minutes I looked intently into Tentnikov’s eyes and concluded: “Yes, he’s just a round fool!”

- Andrey Ivanovich, have mercy! He said, taking him by both hands. - What is the insult? What is the insulting in the word?

“There is nothing offensive in the word itself,” said Tentetnikov, “but in the sense of the word, but in the voice with which it is said, there is an insult.” You - this means: “Remember that you are rubbish; I only accept you because there is no one better, and some Princess Yuzyakin arrived-you know your place, stand at the threshold. ” That's what it means!

Saying this, humble and meek Andrei Ivanovich flashed his eyes; An irritation of an insulted feeling was heard in his voice.

- Yes, even in this sense, - what is it? - said Chichikov.

- How? - said Tentetnikov, looking intently into Chichikov's eyes. “Do you want <I> to continue to be with him after such an act?”

- What kind of act is this? This is not even an act! - said Chichikov.

"What a strange person this Chichikov!" - thought Tentetnikov to himself.

"What a strange person this tentitat!" - Chichikov thought to himself.

- This is not an act, Andrei Ivanovich. This is just a general habit: they say to everyone. Yes, however, why not let this be allowed to be a honored, venerable person?

“This is another matter,” said Tentetnikov. - If he was an old man, poor man, not proud, not cheering, not a general, I would then let him tell me and would have accepted me even respectfully.

“He is a fool! - Chichikov thought to himself. - I will cut off, but the general cannot be allowed! " And after such a thought, he objected to him aloud:

- Fine; Suppose he offended you, but you woven with him: he is you, and you are to him. But parting forever from a trifle - have mercy on what it looks like? How to leave the case that has just begun? If the goal has already been chosen, then here you already need to go ahead. What to look at the fact that a person is spitting! A person is always spitting; Yes, you will not find now in the whole world of one that would not spit.

Tentetnikov was completely puzzled by these words, dumbfounded, looked into Pavel Ivanovich’s eyes and thought to himself: “Strength, but this man is Chichikov!”

"What, however, this eccentric!" - meanwhile, thought Chichikov.

“Let me somehow bother this matter,” he said aloud. - I can go to his excellency and explain what happened on your part by a misunderstanding, in your youth and neglusion of people and light.

- I do not intend to heal in front of him! - said strongly Tentetnikov.

- Keep God to stick! - said Chichikov and crossed himself. - To act as a word of exhortation, as a prudent mediator, but to catch ... Sorry, Andrei Ivanovich, for my good desire and devotion, I did not even expect the words of the <my> to accept you in such an insulting sense!

- Excuse me, Pavel Ivanovich, I'm to blame! - said the touched Tentetnikov, grabbing both his hands gratefully. - Your good participation is dear to me, I swear! But let's leave this conversation, we will never talk about it again.

“In that case, I will just go to the general for no reason,” Chichikov said.

- For what? - asked Tentetnikov, looking at Chichikov in bewilderment.

“Expect respect,” said Chichikov.

"What a strange person this Chichikov!" - thought Tentetnikov.

"What a strange person this tentitat!" - thought Chichikov.

“Since my Brichka,” said Chichikov, “has not yet come into a good condition, then let me take a stroller from you.” I would have been going to him for about ten hours tomorrow.

- Have mercy, what a request! You are a complete gentleman, choose what kind of crew you want: everything is at your disposal.

They said goodbye and dispersed to sleep, not without reasoning about each other's oddities.

A wonderful thing, however, the thing: the next day, when Chichikov’s horses were handed over and he jumped into the stroller with the ease of almost a military man, dressed in a new tailcoat, a white tie and a vest, and rolled to testify to the general, the teutators came into such an excitement of the spirit, which I have not experienced for a long time. All this rusty and dormant course of his thoughts turned into an active-consumer. The indignation of the nervous suddenly took over with all the feelings of a baibak, hitherto immersed in the careless laziness of a baibak. He sat down on the sofa, then approached the window, then took up the book, then wanted to think - unsuccessful wanting! - The thought did not go into his head. I tried not to think about anything - unsuccessful effort! -Excerpts of something similar to thoughts, the ends and tails of thoughts climbed and bent from everywhere to his head. "A strange state!" - he said and moved to the window to look at the road that cut out Dubrov, at the end of which the dust that had not yet managed to lie down, raised by a carriage left. But let's leave Tentnikov and follow Chichikov.

Chapter two

At half an hour with a small horses, Chichikov was carried through a ten -united space - first with orange, then bread, which began to green in the middle of a fresh orani, then a mountain outskirts, with which the views of remote was opened - and a wide apart of the spreading linden introduced it to the general village. The alley of Lip turned into an alley of poplars, fenced from the bottom with wicker boxes, and rested on the cast-iron through gate, through which the curly-gelulus-lumpy carved pediment of the General House looked at eight columns with Corinthian capitals looked. It smelled everywhere with oil paint, which was continuously updated everything, not allowing anything to grow up. The courtyard was like a parquet. The rolled to the entrance, Chichikov with respect jumped onto the porch, ordered himself to report and was introduced directly into the office of the general.

The general struck him with a majestic appearance. He was at that time in a satin raspberry robe. Open gaze, a courageous face, bacenbard and large mustache with a gray back, a haircut is low, and on the back of the head even under a comb, a thick, wide neck, so -called in three floors or three folds with a crack across, a bass with some kind of hoarse, movements of the General . General Betrishchev, like all of us sinners, was gifted with many advantages and many shortcomings. Both, as it happens in a Russian person, was thrown in it in some kind of picture disorder. Self -sacrifice, generosity in decisive moments, courage, mind - and to all this - a fairly rally of self -love, ambitious, pride, petty tickling of personal and much of what a person does not cost. He did not like all who went forward in his service, expressed caustically about them, in sardonic, sharp epigrams. In total, his former comrade, whom he considered below himself both his mind and abilities, was more of him, and who, however, overtook him and was already the governor of the two provinces, and how deliberately those in which his estates were, so he was, so he He found himself as if depending on him. In revenge, he caused him in any case, he criticized any order and saw in all measures and actions his top of Nyzimi. Despite the good heart, the general was mocking. Generally speaking, he loved to excite, loved Fimiam, loved to show off and boast of his mind, loved to know what others did not know, and did not like those people who know something that he does not know. Raised by semi -based upbringing, he wanted to play the role of the Russian master at the same time. With such unevenness in character, with such large, vivid counterparts, he had to inevitably meet a bunch of troubles in the service, as a result of which he resigned, accusing some kind of hostile party of everything and not having generously accuse himself of anything. In retired, he retained the same picture, majestic posture. In the sorek, in a tailcoat, in a dressing gown - he was the same. From the voice to the slightest body move in it, everything was powerful, commanding, which inspired in lower ranks, if not respect, then at least timidity.

Chichikov felt both: both respect and timidity. Tilt respectfully head to one side, he began this way:

- I considered it a duty to introduce myself to your excellency. Naying respect for the valor of husbands who saved the Fatherland on a swearing field, considered it a duty to introduce himself in person to your excellency.

The general, apparently, did not like such an attack. Having made a very gracious movement, he said:

- I am very glad to meet. We ask you to sit down. Where did you serve?

“The field of my service,” said Chichikov, sitting in his chair not in the middle, but obliquely, and grabbing his hand by the handle of the seats, “began in the state ward, Your Excellency; He continued the further flow in different places: he was in the court of court, and in the construction commission, and in customs. My life can be likened to the ship among the waves, your Excellency. On patience, one might say, grew up, a patience is clator, a patience is a spell, and, so to speak, there is nothing else, like one patience. And how much he underwent from enemies, so neither a word nor paint will be able to convey. Now, at the evening, so to speak, my life, I am looking for a corner, where to hang the rest of the days. I suspended the same as a close neighbor of your Excellency ...

- Who has it?

- Tentetnikov, your Excellency.

The general grimaced.

- He, your Excellency, is very repented by the fact that he did not provide proper respect ...

- For what?

- To the merits of your Excellency. Does not find words. He says: “If I could only something ... Because, for sure, he says, I can appreciate the husbands who saved the Fatherland,” he says.

“Have mercy, what is he? .. But I'm not angry!” - said the softened general. - In my soul, I sincerely fell in love with him and is sure that over time he will be a prepared person.

- Absolutely deign to express yourself, your Excellency, a prepoent person, has the gift of a word and owns a pen.

“But he writes, I am tea, trifles, some rhymes?”

- No, your Excellency, not trifles ...

- What is it?

- He writes ... History, your Excellency.

- History! What is the story about?

- The story ... - here Chichikov stopped, and because that the general was sitting in front of him, or simply to give more importance to the subject, added: - The story of generals, your excellency.

- As about the generals! What generals?

“In general, about the generals, your Excellency, in the community ... that is, speaking, in fact, about domestic generals,” Chichikov said, and he thought: “I carry such a nonsense!”

-Sorry, I do not really understand ... Well, this is the story of some time, or individual biographies, and, moreover, whether all, or only participating in the twelfth year?

- Exactly, your Excellency participating in the twelfth year! - Having said this, he thought in himself: "Though kill, I do not understand."

“So why won't he come to me?” I could collect him a lot of curious materials.

“He doesn’t dare, Your Excellency.”

- What nonsense! From some empty word ... Yes, I am not at all such a person. Perhaps I myself am ready to come to him.

“He will not allow him, he will come,” Chikov said, and at the same time thought in himself: “The generals fell, but, by the way; Meanwhile, after all, the tongue completely confused his foolishness. ”

There was a rustle in the office. The walnut door of the carved cabinet opened itself. In the reverse half of the dissolved door, grabbing the door handle with a wonderful hand, a living figure appeared. If a transparent picture flashed in a dark room, lit in the back with a lamp, it would not have struck like this figure shining with her life, which exactly appeared then to illuminate the room. It seemed that, as if with her, the sun beam flew into the room, suddenly illuminating the ceiling, cornice and dark corners. She seemed to be brilliant growth. It was seduction; This happened from the extraordinary harmony and harmonious correlation among themselves all parts of the body, from the head to the fingers. A one -color dress, on it, was thrown on it with such a “taste” that it seemed that the seamstresses made a meeting among themselves, as if to better remove it. It was a deception. She dressed somehow, by herself; In two, three places, she grabbed an unreasonable piece of fabric, and he clung and settled around it in such folds that the sculptor would immediately transfer them to marble, and the young ladies dressed in fashion, everyone seemed to her some kind of pestrates. Despite the fact that Chichikov was almost familiar with her face according to the drawings of Andrei Ivanovich, he looked at her like a dumbfounded one, and after, already waking up, he noticed that she had a significant drawback, namely - a lack of thickness.

- I recommend you my balloon! - said the general, turning to Chichikov. “However, I still don't know your name and patronymic.”

- However, should the name and patronymic of a person who have not marked himself with valor be known? - said Chichikov.

- Still, however, you need to know ...

“Pavel Ivanovich, Your Excellency,” said Chichikov, with a slight tilt of his head to one side.

- Ulnka! Pavel Ivanovich has now said the successful news. Our neighbor Totatetikov is not at all as stupid person as we believed. He is engaged in a rather important matter: the history of the Generals of the twelfth year.

The street suddenly suddenly flared up and perked up.

- But who thought he was a stupid person? She said quickly. “It could only think of one cherry that you believe, dad, who is an empty and low person!”

- Why low? He is empty, this is true, ”said the general.

“He is crazy and disgusting, not only empty,” Stnya grabbed vividly. - Who so offended his brothers and kicked his own sister from the house, that ugly man ...

- Why, they only tell it.

- They will not tell in vain. You, father, have a kind soul and a rare heart, but you act so that another will think about you completely different. You will take a person about whom you yourself know that he is dwell, because he is only a redbie and the master will get in front of you.

- My soul! After all, I can’t drive him away, ”said the general.

- Why drive away, but why love?!

“And here is not, your Excellency,” Chichikov said Ulinka, with a slight tilt of his head, with a pleasant smile. - In Christianity, we must love these.

And then, turning to the general, he said with a smile, already somewhat cheeky:

-Have you deigned, your excellency, to ever hear about what it is-“Love us with black, and everyone will love us with white”?

- No, I didn’t hear.

“And this is a prerezure joke,” Chichikov said with a rogue smile. - On the estate, your Excellency, with Prince Gukzovsky, who, without a doubt, your Excellency, deign to know ...

- Don't know.

- There was a manager, your Excellency, from the Germans, a young man. On the occasion of the supply of recruit and other things, he had the need to come to the city and, of course, smear the judicial. - Here Chichikov, squinting his eyes, expressed in his face, as the judicial ones are demolished. - However, they also fell in love, treated him. Once, once, he said at dinner: "Well, gentlemen, someday to me, to the estate to the prince." They say: "We will come." Soon, after that, it happened to go to the court for the investigation, in the case that happened in the possessions of Count Trekhometiev, who, without a doubt, also deign to know.

- Don't know.

-They did not make the investigation itself, but they wraped the whole court to the economic courtyard, to the old man, the count's economy, and three days and three nights without a worship-to cards. The samovar and punch, of course, do not leave the table. They were already tired of the old man. In order to get rid of them somehow, he says: "You would, gentlemen, have drove to the prince of the ruler of the Germans: he is not far from here and is waiting for you." “And and really,” they say, and Spallupan, unshaven and sleepy, as they were, on carts and to the German ... And the German, your Excellency, must know, at that time had just married. He married a college, young, subtile (Chichikov expressed her subtility in his person). They sit two over tea, without thinking about anything, the doors suddenly open - and a host burst.

- I imagine - good! - said the general, laughing.

- The ruler was dumbfounded, says: "What do you want?" - "A! They say that you are! " And suddenly, with this word, the change of faces and physiognomy ... "In case! How much wine is smoked according to the name? Show the books! " That Sudy-Tuda. "Hey, witnesses!" They took it, tied up, yes to the city, but a year and a half and spent a German in prison.

- Here on! - said the general.

The street threw up her hands.

- Wife - to trouble! - continued Chichikov. -Well, what can some inexperienced young woman? Thank you for having good people who advised to go to the world. He escaped with two thousand and a mutual dinner. And at dinner, when everyone was already amused, and he also, so they say to him: “Is it ashamed to do so with us? You would like to see us with the given, but shaved, but in tailcoats. No, you love us with black, and everyone will love us white. ”

The general burst out laughing; Olivka groaned painfully.

“I don't understand, dad, how can you laugh!” She said quickly. The anger drove her beautiful forehead of her ... - The unconscious act, for which I do not know, Kuda would have to be asleep ...

“My friend, I don’t justify them at all,” said the general, “but what if it’s funny?” How is it: “Love us with white”? ..

“Black, Your Excellency,” Chichikov picked up.

“Love us with black, and everyone will love us white.” Ha, ha, ha, ha!

And the general’s body began to hesitate with laughter. The shoulders, which were once thick epaulettes, shook, just as if they were still wearing thick epaulettes.

Chichikov was also resolved by the interior of laughter, but, out of respect for the general, he let him in the letter E: he, he, heh, heh, hey! And his torso also began to hesitate with laughter, although his shoulders did not shake, because they did not wear thick epipot.

- I imagine, an unshaven court was good! - said the general, continuing to laugh.

“Yes, your Excellency, be that as it may ... Without a wake ... A three -day vigil is the same post: they were gathered, gathered,” said Chichikov, continuing to laugh.

The street fell into the chair and closed her beautiful eyes with her hand; As if annoying that there was no one to share indignation with, she said:

“I don’t know, only one annoyance takes me.”

In fact, the feelings that were born in the hearts of three who talked people were unusually strange. One was ridiculous by the clumsy inability of the German. It was funny to the other because the rogues were ridiculously dodgy. The third was sad that an unfair act was committed impunity. There was not only the fourth who would think precisely on these words that made laughter in one and sadness in another. What does it mean, however, that in his fall, a perisive dirty person requires love for himself? Is the animal instinct? Or a weak cry of the soul, drowned out by a heavy oppression of vile passions, still breaking through the village bark of abominations, still yelling: "Brother, save!" There was no fourth, which would be the most difficult to die of his brother.

“I don’t know,” said Ulinka, taking her hand away, “she only takes me annoyance.”

“Just please do not be angry with us,” said the general. - We are not to blame for anything here. Kiss me and leave for me, because I will now dress for dinner. After all, you, ”said the general, suddenly turning to Chichikov,“ do you have lunch with me? ”

- If only your Excellency ...

- Without a ceremony. There is a cabbage soup!

Chichikov pleasantly tilted his head, and when he later lifted her up, he no longer saw the street. She disappeared. Its embarrassed, in dense mustache and bacenbards, a giant-chamber, with a silver sucker and an sleeve in his hands.

“Will you allow me to dress with you?” - said the general, throwing a robe and pouring the sleeves of a shirt on the heroic hands.

“Have mercy, not only dress, but you can do anything to me with your excellency,” Chichikov said.

The general began to wash, spraying and snorting like a duck. Water with soap flew in all directions.

- How is it? He said, wiping his thick neck from all sides, - love us white? ..

- Black, Your Excellency.

“Love us with black, and everyone will love us white.” Very very good!

Chichikov was in the spirit of extraordinary; He felt some kind of inspiration.

- Your Excellency! - he said.

- What? - said the general.

- There is another story.

- Which?

-The story is also funny, but it’s not funny to me. Even so that if your Excellency ...

- How so?

- Yes, your Excellency, how! .. - Then Chichikov looked around and, seeing that the valet with a looha came out, began to like this: - I have an uncle, a decrepit old man. He has three hundred souls and, besides me, no one. He himself cannot control the name, by decrepitude, but he does not give me either. And what strange reason gives: “I, he says, I do not know the nephew; Maybe he is a mot. Let him prove to me that he is a reliable person, let him acquire three hundred souls by himself, then I will give him his three hundred souls. ”

- What a fool!

“It was fair to notice, Your Excellency.” But imagine now my position ... - Here Chichikov, having lowered his voice, began to speak as if in secret: - He has in his house, your Excellency, has a key holder, and the key house has children. And look, everything will go to them.

“The stupid old man survived from the mind, and nothing more,” said the general. “Only I don’t see what I can like here.”

- I came up with this. Now, as long as new revision fairy tales have not been presented, there will be a lot of large estates from the landowners, along with the living souls, who have served and dead ... So, for example, your excellency give them to me in the form, as if they were alive, with the commission of the merchant of the fortress , I would then introduce this fortress to the old man, and he, no matter how it turned, and would give me an inheritance.

Then the general erupted with such a laugh as it was unlikely that a man laughed: as he was, he fell into the chair; He threw his head back and almost choked. The whole house was alarmed. The valet appeared. The daughter came running in fright.

- Dad, what happened to you?

- Nothing, my friend. Ha, ha, ha! Go to yourself, we will now have to dinner. Ha, ha, ha!

And suffering several times, the general's laughter broke up with the new force, distributing from the front to the last room in high sonorous generals.

Chichikov was concerned with an end to this unusual laughter.

- Well, brother, I'm sorry: the devil himself has managed to such a thing. Ha, ha, ha! Put the old man, slip him the dead! Ha, ha, ha, ha! Uncle, uncle! What fools in the uncle! Ha, ha, ha, ha!

Chichikov’s position was embarrassed: there was a valet right there, opening his mouth and a bulging of his eyes.

“Your Excellency, because this laughter was invented by tears,” he said.

- Sorry, brother! Well, I was silent. Yes, I would give five hundred thousand for the only to look at your uncle while you bring him a merchant to dead souls. What, is he too old? How old is he?

- Eighty years, your Excellency. But this is a cell, I would ... - so ... - Chichikov looked significantly in the face of the general and at the same time squinted at the valet.

- Go out, brother. You will come after, ”the general said to the valet. The barbel retired.

- Yes, your Excellency ... This, your Excellency, is such that I would like to hold him a secret ...

- Of course, I really understand that. Eka is a fool old man! After all, in eighty years, a sort of nonsense will come in the head! What, how does he look like? Bodr? Holding on your feet?

- Holds, but with difficulty.

- Eca fool! And are there any teeth?

“Two teeth of everything, your Excellency.”

- Eska donkey! You, brother, do not be angry ... But he was donkey ...

“Exactly, Your Excellency.” Although he is a relative to me, and it’s hard to confess in this, but indeed a donkey.

However, as the reader could realize himself, Chichikov was not difficult to confess to this, especially since he was unlikely to ever had any uncle.

- So if, your Excellency, you will be so kind ...

- To give you dead souls? Yes, for such an invention, I have them with the ground, with housing! Take your entire cemetery! Ha, ha, ha, ha! The old man, old man! Ha, ha, ha, ha! What fools! Ha, ha, ha, ha!

And the general's laughter went to surrender to the general chambers again. [91]

Chapter Three

“No, I'm wrong,” said Chichikov, finding himself back in the middle of open fields and spaces, “no, I will not manage it. As soon as God gives, I’ll finish it all and become a truly wealthy, wealthy person, I will then take it very differently: I will have both a cook and a house, as a full bowl, but there will be the economic part in order. The ends will come in to the end, and little by little one year will be deposited for the offspring, unless God sends the wife of a ferte ... ” - hey you are foolish!

Selifan and Parsley looked around both from the goats.

- Where are you going?

“Yes, they deigned to order, Pavel Ivanovich,“ to Colonel Koshkarev, ”Selifan said.

- Did you ask the road?

-I, Pavel Ivanovich, deign to see, as I was busy around the stroller, so it is ... I only saw the general groom ... and Parsley asked the coachman.

- That's a fool! On parsley, it is said, do not rely: parsley log.

“After all, it’s not wisdom here,” said Petrushka, looking at a squint, “by okrom that, after, after a mountain, to take a hint, there is nothing more.”

- And you, okrom Sivukhi, nothing more, tea, and did not take into your mouth? Tea, and now you have a night?

Seeing that it turned into a won in which direction, Parsley twisted only his nose. He wanted to say that he had not even tried it, and somehow it became ashamed himself.

“It's good to go in a stroller,” Selifan said, turning around.

- What?

-I say, Pavel Ivanovich, that in a stroller, your mercy is good to go, get better, like in a brick-does not shake.

- Go, went! You are not asked about it.

Selifan glowed slightly with a scourge on the steep sides of the horses and turned the speech to Parsley:

“Hey, a man Koshkarev put on the master, they say like a German: you don’t recognize at a distance,” he performs in a zhuralin, like a German. And on the woman, it’s not that a scarf, as it happens, is a pie or a kokoshnik on their heads, and the German Kapor like the Germans walk, you know, in the hoods - this is the name, you know, the Kapor. German is such a caper.

- And you seem to dress you with a German and to the Kapor! - said Petrushka, witty over Selifan and grinning. But what kind of face came out of this grin! And there was no kind of like a grin, but just like a person, having taken a runny nose into his nose and sneezing a runny nose at his nose, did not sneeze, but he remained in the position of a man gathering to sneeze.

Chichikov looked from under the bottom of his face, wanting to know what was being done there, and said: “Good! And also imagines that a handsome man! ” It must be said that Pavel Ivanovich was confidently convinced that Petrushka was in love with his beauty, while the last time he had time for if he had an erysipelas.

“That's how they guessed, Pavel Ivanovich,” said Selifan, turning off the goat, “to beg another horse from Andrei Ivanovich, in exchange for Chubaroy;” He would, by a friendly disposition towards you, would not refuse, and this is a horse, right, a scoundrel-loshad and an obstacle.

- Go, went, do not chat! - Chichikov said and thought to himself: "In fact, I did not guess in vain."

Meanwhile, a light stroller rushed with a light move. It easily rose up, although sometimes there was an uneven road; It easily sank downhill, although the descents of country roads were restless. They went down from the mountain. The road went to meadows through the wrist of the river, past the mills. Sands flickered in the distance, an aspen groves protruded alone from the other; The vine bushes quickly flew by, thin alder and silver poplaries, struck by the branches of Selifan and Parsley sitting on the goats. From the latter, they dumped a cartoon every minute. The harsh minister jumped off the goats, scolded a stupid tree and the owner who planted him, but he did not guess to tie the cap or even hold with his hand, hoping that maybe there would be no further. The trees became thicker: the birch began to join the aspen and alder, and soon the forest Gushchina formed around. The light of the sun was hidden. Pines darkened and ate. The unfinished darkness of the endless forest was gathering and seemed to be preparing to turn into night. And suddenly between the trees - light, there and there are between branches and stumps, like living silver or mirrors. The forest began to be lit, the trees are thin, screams were heard - and suddenly a lake in front of them. The water plain of the miles is four across, around the tree, behind their hut. Twenty people, to the waist, on the shoulder and throat in the water, pulled a net to the opposite shore. In the midst of them, he swam overly, shouted and bustled for all a man, almost the same measure as in the thickness, a round circle, an accurate watermelon. Due to the thickness, he could no longer drown in any case and no matter how he somersaults, wanting to dive, the water would have taken it upstairs; And if two more people sat down on his back, he would, like a stubborn bubble, stayed with them at the top of the water, he only grunted under them and let his bubbles with his nose and mouth.

“This one, Pavel Ivanovich,” said Selifan, turning from a goat, “there should be a master, Colonel Koshkarev.”

- From what?

- Because he has a body, to see, whitewashing than that of others, and a respectful debate, like a master.

The screams, meanwhile, became more clearly. The master’s laminum shouted loudly and loudly:

- Tell me, pass it, Denis, Kozma! Kozma, take Denis's tail! Thomas is big, the bans are tudus, where Foma is smaller! Come on the right, come to the right! Wait, stand, damn you both! I confused me in a net! They hooked, I say, damned, hooked on the navel.

The wires of the right wing stopped, seeing that an unforeseen opportunity had really happened: the master was confused on the network.

“You see,” said Selifan Petrushka, “the master dragged like a fish.”

Barin flew and, wanting to get out, rolled over on his back, with a belly up, entangled in the net. Fearing to break the network, he sailed along with a fish caught, ordering himself to intercept only a rope. Bringing him with a rope, they threw her end to the shore. A man from twenty fishermen standing on the shore, picked up an end and began to carefully drag him. Having reached a small place, the master became on his feet, covered with cages of the network, like in the summer, a ladies' pen under a through glove, - looked up and saw a guest entering the dam. Seeing the guest, he nodded his head. Chichikov took off his cartuz and courteously bowed from the stroller.

- Have you lunch? - Barin shouted, approaching with a fish caught to the shore, holding one hand above the eyes of a visor in defense of the sun, the other lower - in the manner of Venus of a media, emerging from the bath.

“No,” said Chichikov.

- Well, so thank God.

- And what? - Chichikov asked curiously, holding the caps of his head.

- But what! - said the Barin, who founded on the shore along with crusts and crucians, who fought at his feet and jumped on arshin from the ground. - This is nothing, do not look at it; But the thing is where! .. And show you, the Thomas is large, sturgeon. -Two healthy men pulled some monster out of the tub. - What is the princes? I came from the river!

- Yes, this is a whole prince! - said Chichikov.

-That's the same. Go ahead now, and I am for you. Kucher, you, brother, take the road lower, through the garden. Shoots, Telepen Thomas Menshoy, remove the partition. And I am for you - how here, before you have time to look back.

“The Colonel is eccentric,” thought <Chichikov>, having finally drove the endless dam and approaching the huts, of which, like a herd of ducks, scattered along the slope of the elevator, while others stood below on stews. Networks, nets, nonsense were hung everywhere. Thomas Menshoi took off the partition, the stroller drove a garden and found herself in the square near the outdated wooden church. Behind the church, away, the roofs of the Lord's buildings were visible.

- And here I am! - there was a voice on the side. Chichikov looked around. Barin was already rode near him, dressed, on tremors-a herbal-green nank frock coat, yellow pants and a neck without a tie, on the manner of Cupid! He sat sideways on tremors, taking all the tremors. Chichikov wanted to tell him something, but the fat man had already disappeared. The tremors appeared on the other side and only a voice was heard: “Take the pike and seven crucians to the cook, and give the sturgeon here: I will light it on the yeast.” Voices rang out again: “Thomas big and Thomas Menshoy! Kozma and Denis! " When he drove up to the porch of the house, to his great amazement, the fat master was already on the porch and took him into his arms. As he managed to fly so, it was incomprehensible. They kissed three times.

“I brought you a bow from his Excellency,” Chichikov said.

- From what Excellency?

- From your relative, from General Alexander Dmitrievich.

- Who is Alexander Dmitrievich?

“General Betrishchev,” answered Chichikov with some amazement.

“I don’t know, sir, unfamiliar.”

Chichikov came into greater amazement.

“How is this? .. I hope, at least, that I have the pleasure of talking to Colonel Koshkarev?”

- Petr Petrovich Rooster, Rooster Peter Petrovich! - the owner picked up.

Chichikov was dumbfounded.

- Here you have! How are you fools, ”he said, turning to Selifan and Parsley, who both opened their mouths and bulged his eyes, one sitting on the goats, the other standing at the door of the carriage, - how are you fools? After all, you are told - to Colonel Koshkarev ... But this is Peter Petrovich Rooster ...

- The guys did perfectly! - said Peter Petrovich. - For this, you in the chapo of vodka and kulebyak in addition to you. Put the horses and step this time in the human one!

“I will confuse,” said Chichikov, bowing, “such an unexpected mistake ...

“Not a mistake,” Petr Petrovich Rooster said vividly, “is not a mistake.” Previously, you try, what is lunch, and then you will say: is it a mistake? I am humblely ask, ”said <he>, taking Chichikov by the arm and inserting him into the inner chambers.

Chichikov, squeezing, walked on the door sideways to give the owner to go with him; But this was in vain: the owner would not have passed, and he was not there. It was only audible how his speeches were heard in the yard: “Why is Thomas big? Why is he still not here? Rotoszey Emelyan, run to the cheating cook to gut the sturgeon as soon as possible. Milks, caviar, gutted and bream in the ear, and crucian carp - into the sauce. Yes crayfish, crayfish! Rotoszey Thomas Menshoy, where is the crayfish? Crayfish, I say, crayfish?! " And all rang out for a long time - crayfish and crayfish.

“Well, the owner slammed shut,” said Chichikov, sitting down in his chair and examining the corners and walls.

“And here I am,” said, entering, the owner and leading two young men, in summer frock coats. Subtle, like willow whips, drove them up almost as a whole arshin above Peter Petrovich.

“My sons, gymnasium students.” We arrived on the holidays. Nikolasha, you stay with the guest, and you, Aleksash, follow me.

And again, Peter Petrovich Rooster disappeared.

Chichikov took up Nikolas. Nikolasha was talkative. He said that in their gymnasium they are not very well taught, that they will more favorable to those whom the mothers send gifted gifts, that the city has an Ingermanland hussar regiment; That the Coatmist of Vetvetsky is better than a horse than that of the colonel himself, although the lieutenant of the layers drives much more cleaner.

- And what, in what state the estate of your father? - asked Chichikov.

“Inherent,” the father himself said to this, who founded himself in the living room again, “is laid down.”

Chichikov remains to make the same movement with his lips that a person does, how it goes to zero and ends with nothing.

- Why did you put? - he asked.

- Yes. All went to lay, so why lag behind others? They say profitable. Moreover, everything lived here, let me still try to live in Moscow.

“Fool, fool! “Thought Chichikov,” he squeezes everything, and he will make the children with mothers. He would have remained, kulebyak, in the village. "

“But I know what you think,” said the rooster.

- What? - asked Chichikov, embarrassed.

- You think: “Fool, this fool! He called for dinner, but there is still no lunch. ” It will be ready, respectable. The cut girl of the braid will not have time, as he rushes.

- Father, Plato Mikhalych is going! - said Alexasha, looking out the window.

- High on the bay of the horse! - picked up Nikolash, bending down to the window. “Do you think, Aleksash, our spent worse than him?”

- Worse no worse, but the performance is not like that.

Between them, a dispute began about bay and charm. Meanwhile, a handsome man entered the room-slender growth, light brilliant shiny curls and dark eyes. Grendy with a copper collar, a muzzle dog, a passage dog, entered after him.

- Have you lunch? - asked Peter Petrovich Rooster.

“I dined,” said the guest.

- Well, do you laugh, or something, have come at me? - said, angry, a rooster. - What am I in you after lunch?

“However, Peter Petrovich,” the guest said, grinning, “I can console you with not attending anything at dinner: there is no appetite at all.”

- And what was the catch if you saw! What sturgeon granted! Karasy did not count.

“Even enviable to listen to you,” the guest said. - Teach me to be as fun as you.

- Yes, from the same to miss? Have mercy! - said the owner.

- How why miss? - Because it is boring.

- You eat little, that's all. Try to have lunch carefully. After all, this has recently invented boredom. Nobody missed before.

- Yes, full boast! As if you never missed you?

- Never! And I don’t know, even there is no time for bored. You will wake up in the morning - you need to drink tea, and here is a clerk, and here it is for fishing, and here is lunch. After lunch, you won’t have time to snatch, and then dinner, and after that the cook came - you need to order lunch for tomorrow. When to miss?

During the conversation, Chichikov examined the guest.

Platon Mikhalych Platonov was Achilles and Parid [92] together: slender addition, picture growth, freshness - everything was collected in it. A pleasant grin with a slight expression of irony, as it were, strengthened its beauty. But, despite all this, there was something unexplored and sleepy in him. Passions, sorrows and shocks did not bring wrinkles on the virgin, fresh face, but with the same time did not revive him.

“I admit, I, too,” said Chichikov, “I can’t understand, if you allow you to notice it, I can’t understand how, with such an appearance as yours, I would be bored.” Of course, there may be other reasons: a shortage of money, oppression from some attackers, as there are sometimes those who are ready to encroach even on life itself.

“In that <and business> that there is none of this,” said Platonov. “Believe that sometimes I would like it to have any anxiety and excitement.” Well, at least someone would just angry me. But no! Boring - and nothing more.

- I don't understand. But maybe you have an insufficient, small number of souls?

- Not at all, my brother and I have ten thousand acres and with them a thousand souls of peasants.

- And at the same time miss. Unclear! But maybe the estate is in disorder? Were there a crop failure, many people died out?

- On the contrary, everything is in the best order, and my brother is a great owner.

- I don't understand! - said Chichikov and shrugged.

“But we will drive away boredom now,” the owner said. - Running, Aleksash, wider to the kitchen and tell the cook to send us an unfastening. But where is the Rotose Emelyan and the thief Antoshka? Why don't they give snacks?

But the door disappeared. The Rotose Emelyan and the thief Antoshka appeared with napkins, set the table, put a tray with six decanters of multi -colored tinctures. Soon around the trays and graphs arranged the neckline necklace-caviar, cheeses, salty loads, openers, and new offices from the kitchen in closed plates, through which the grumbling oil was audible. The Rotoszey Emelyan and the thief Antoshka were good and quick people. These master gave names only because without nicknames everything somehow went out freshly, but he did not like the freshness; He himself was kind of soul, but the word was loved by Spicy. However, people were not angry for this.

A snack was followed by lunch. Here the good -natured owner became a perfect robber. He slightly noticed someone one piece, put him right away, saying: "Without a couple, neither a person nor a bird can live in the world." Two guest ate - the third was leaning to him, saying: “What is the number two? God loves trinity". Three guest ate - he was to him: “Where is the cart about three wheels? Who is building a hut about three corners? " For four he had a saying again, for five - too. Chichikov ate something almost twelve lomers and thought: "Well, now the owner will do nothing more." It wasn’t there: the owner, without saying a word, put him on a plate a ridge of a calf, fried on a spit, the best part, whatever, with the kidneys, and what a calf!

“Two years raised in milk,” said the owner, “looked after as a son!”

- I can not! - said Chichikov.

- Yes, you try, then say: I can’t!

- It will not rise. No place.

- But there was no place in the church. The mayor ascended - it was found. But there was such a crush that the apple had nowhere to fall. You just try: this piece is the same mayor.

Chichikov tried - indeed, the piece was like a mayor. He found a place, but it seemed that nothing could be placed.

There was also a story with wines. Having received money from a pawnshop, Peter Petrovich stocked up a provisions ten years in advance. He poured and added it every now and then; What did the guests did not finish, gave it to Alexash and Nikolash, who clapped a glass behind a glass, and stood up from the table-as if there were nothing, as if drank a glass of water. It was not that with the guests: by force, by force, they dragged onto the balcony and because they fit in the chairs. The owner, as he sat in his own, was some four-seater, and he immediately fell asleep. His fat property turned into Kuznetsk fur. Through an open mouth and nasal nostrils, she began to make some sounds that are not in new music. There was everything-a drum, a flute, and some kind of jerky sound, like a dog barking.

- Ec is whistling it! - said Platonov.

Chichikov laughed.

“Of course, if you have lunch,” said Platonov, “how to come boredom!” Here the dream will come.

“Yes,” said Chichikov lazily. His eyes became unusually small. -But still, however, sorry, I can’t understand how you can miss. There are so many means against boredom.

- What?

- But you never know for a young man! You can dance, play on some instrument ... and not that-get married.

- On whom? Tell.

- Yes, as if there are no good and rich brides in the circle?

- Not really.

- Well, look in other places, ride. - Then a rich thought flashed in Chichikov’s head, his eyes became larger. - Yes, here is an excellent remedy! He said, looking into the eyes of Platonov.

- Which?

- Journey.

- Kuda go?

“Yes, if you are free, then we’ll go with me,” Chichikov said, and thought to himself, looking at Platonov: “And that would be good: then you could in half the costs, and the stroller’s subordination was attributed to his account.”

- Where are you going?

- But how to say - where? I’m going to go, not so much by my need, but for the need for another. General Betrishchev, a close friend and, one might say, a philanthropist, asked to visit relatives ... Of course, relatives are relatives, but partly, so to speak, for himself; For to see the light, the flutter of people - whoever we say, is, as it were, a living book, the second science.

Platonov thought.

Chichikov, meanwhile, thought so: “Right, it would be < You can even be so that all costs will be on his account. You can even make it so that they go on his horses, and mine will subside in his village. For a savings, you can leave the stroller in his village, and take his stroller on the road. ”

"Well? Why not go? - Meanwhile thought Platonov. -Perhaps it will be more fun. I have nothing to do at home, the farm is already in the hands of my brother; Therefore, there is no disorder. Why, in fact, do not travel? "

“Do you agree,” he said out loud, “to stay at the brother of two days?” Otherwise, he will not let me go.

- With great pleasure! At least three.

- Well, if so - hands! We are going! - said, reviving, Platonov.

- Bravo! - said Chichikov, slamming his arm. - We are going!

- Where? Where? - exclaimed the owner, waking up and the bulging on them of their eyes. - No, sovereigns, and the wheels are ordered to remove from your stroller, and your stallion, Plato Mikhalych, from here now for fifteen miles. No, here you will spend it today, and tomorrow after the early dinner and go to yourself.

"Here you have!" - thought Chichikov. Platonov did not say anything to this, knowing that the cock was holding on his customs tightly. It was necessary to stay.

But they were awarded an amazing spring evening. The owner arranged a walk on the river. Twelve rowers, twenty -four oars, with songs, carried them along the smooth ridge of the mirror lake. From the lake they swept into the river, unlimited, with gentle shores on both sides. If only water moved with a stream. On the boat, they drank tea with kalachi, approaching every minute under the rivers stretched out of the river for fishing with tackle. Even before the tea, the <master> managed to undress and jump into the river, where he floundered and rustled for half an hour with the fishermen, shouting at Thomas Bolshoi and Kuzma, and, shouting, having fluttered, intending in the water, he found himself on a boat with appetite and drank tea so that he was drinking that It was envious. Meanwhile, the sun set. Heavenly clarity remained. The screams gave out more as much as possible. The fishermen seemed to have been everywhere off the coast of a group of swimming children: clapping on the water, laughter was given to daler. The rowers, grabbing twenty -four oars at once, suddenly lifted all the oars up, and the boat by itself, like a light bird, strove on a motionless mirror surface. Healthy, fresh, like a girl, a baby, the third from the steering wheel, sang loudly alone, developing in a pure voice; Five picked up, six took out - and a song, like Rus', spilled; And, blocking his ear with his hand, as if the singers themselves were lost in her infinity. I got some kind of preferential, and Chichikov thought: "Oh, right, I will give myself a village someday!" “Well, what's good here,” Platonov thought, “in this mournful song?” From her even greater longing finds his soul. ”

They returned back already by twilight. The oars hit in the dark on waters that no longer reflected the sky. The lights were barely visible along the shores of the lake. A month rose when they stuck to the shore. Everywhere on tripods were cooked by fishermen of the ear, all of ruffs and from burning fish. Everything was already at home. Geese, cows, goats have long been driven, and the dust itself had long subsided from them, and the shepherds who drove them stood at the gate, waiting for the krynka of milk and invitation to his ear. There and there they heard a dialect and a human Homon, the loud barking of the dogs of their village and distant - alien villages. A month rose, began to be illuminated by darkness; And all finally illuminated - both the lake and the hut; The lights turned pale; The smoke from the pipes, washed by rays, became visible. Nikolasha and Aleksash flashed at that time in front of them on two dashing stallions, in the overtaking of each other; The dust rose behind them, like from a herd of rams. "Eh, right, I will give myself a village someday!" - thought Chichikov. Babenka and small chichonki began to introduce himself again. Who will not warm this evening?

And at dinner, they overshadowed again. When Pavel Ivanovich entered the allotted room for sleeping and, lying to bed, felt his tummy: “Drum! - He said, - no mayor will rise! " It was necessary for such a step in circumstances: behind the wall was the owner of the owner. The wall was thin, and everything that was said there was heard. The owner ordered the cook, under the guise of an early breakfast, for tomorrow, a decisive dinner. And how I ordered! The dead would have had an appetite. And he sucked his lips, and smacked. It only was heard: "Yes, fry, let me get good!" And the cook sentenced a thin fistula: “I listen, sir. May with. You can, and like that. "

- Yes, make a kulebyak on four corners. At one angle, you put my cheeks of sturgeon and Vyaziga, in the other launch buckwheat gruel, and mushrooms with a ray, and sweet milk, but brains, and even what you know there ...

-Listen, sir. It will be possible.

- Yes, so that she, you understand, understand - would be browned, and from the other to start her easier. With the under the point, by the poison, you understand, baking it so that it is crumbling, so that all of it penetrates, you know, juice, so that it does not hear it in your mouth-how the snow would melt.

"Damn it! - Thought Chichikov, turning tossing. “Just won't let me sleep!”

- Yes, make me pork Sichug. Put a piece of ice into the middle so that it flies well. Yes, to make a lining, a side dish, a side dish, so that it is richer! Put it with crayfish, and fried with a small fish, and pour a minced meat of snowballs, and add small cuts, drying, and loaders, and turnips, and carrots, but beans, but there are still some root there?

“It will be possible to let the bruitsy or beets with an asterisk,” said the cook.

- Let both the bruzzle and beets. And to the hot you make me what a gasket ...

- A completely dream disappeared! - said Chichikov, turning over to the other side, wrapped his head in a pillow and closed himself with a blanket so as not to hear anything. But through the blanket it was heard constantly: "Yes, roasts, yes subteck, let me get good." He fell asleep on some kind of turkey.

The day before, the guests were overstated that Platonov could no longer ride; The stallion was sent with the groom of the rooster. They sat in a stroller. The face of the dog lazily went after the carriage: he also overeat.

“No, this is already too much,” Chichikov said when they left the yard. -This is even in a Swing. Are you restless, Plato Mikhalych? The hungry was a stroller, and suddenly it became uneasy. Parsley, you, rightly, by stupidity, began to shift? Some boxes stick out everywhere!

Plato grinned.

“This, I will explain to you,” he said, “Pyotr Petrovich put on the road.”

“Exactly,” said Parsley, turning from a goat, “it was ordered to put everything in a stroller - pishkets and pies.”

“Exactly, sir, Pavel Ivanovich,” said Selifan, turning from a goat, cheerful, “a very venerable master.” Mistying landowner! He sent champagne on a glass of champagne. Exactly, sir, and ordered to let the dishes-very good dish, delicate bunches from the table. There was no such respectful gentleman yet.

- Do you see? He satisfied everyone, ”said Platonov. - However, just tell me: do you have time that <would call in one village, hence ten miles? I would like to say goodbye to my sister and son -in -law.

“With great pleasure,” said Chichikov.

- From this you will not be in the way: my son -in -law is a very wonderful person.

- For which part? - asked Chichikov.

-This is the first owner that he has ever been to Rus'. He at ten years old, having bought a frustrated estate, barely giving twenty thousand, elevated him to the point that he now gets two hundred thousand.

- Ah, venerable person! Here is a sort of man life is worth it to be transferred to the teachings of people! Very, very nice to meet. What is the name?

- Kostanzhoglo. [93]

- And the name and patronymic?

- Konstantin Fedorovich.

- Konstantin Fedorovich Kostanzhoglo. Very nice to meet you. It is instructive to find out a sort of person. - And Chichikov went into questions about Kostanzhogl, and everything that he learned about him from Platonov was, for sure, amazingly.

“Look, his lands are already beginning in this place,” said Platonov, pointing to the fields. “You will see the difference from others at once.” Kucher, here you will take the road to the left. Do you see this young man Les? This is seeded. At the other fifteen, the other did not rise <would have risen, and he grew up in his eight. Look, here the forest is over. Bread has already begun; And after fifty acres, there will be a forest again, also seeded, and there again. Look at bread, how many times they are thicker than the other.

- I see. But how is he doing it?

“Well, ask him, you will see that ... [94] This is all, so omitted that you will not find anywhere.” Not only does he know what kind of soil he loves, knows what neighborhood for whom is needed, near the forest you need to sow what bread. We all have the land cracking with drought, but he does not. He calculates how much humidity is necessary, so many wood will dilute; Everything plays two or three roles for him: a forest, and a field of fertilizer from leaves and from the shadow. And this is so.

- An amazing person! - said Chichikov and looked curiously at the fields.

Everything was unusual. The forests were blocked; Cross -country courtyards came across everywhere, also not without reason built -in, enviously contained; Bread laying the growth of the giant. It was abundantly and bread everywhere. It was suddenly evident that the ace-host was living. Climbing to a small hill, <saw> on the opposite side a large village, scattered on three mountain elevations. Everything here was rich: thorny streets, strong huts; Whether the cart stood - the cart was strong and new; Whether the horse came across - the horse was fattened and kind; Cattle - as a selection. Even the peasant pig looked at the nobleman. So it can be seen that those men who rowing, as in the song, are in a shovel with a shovel, live here. There were no Aglitsky parks, arbors and bridges with ventures and various avenues in front of the house. Clothing yards stretched from hut to the Lord's yard. On the roof is a large flashlight, not for species, but for examining where and in what place and how work was carried out.

They drove up to the house. There was no owner; Their wife, the sister of Platonov, blond, white, white, with a directly Russian expression, met their wife, as well as a beauty, but as much as he was met. It seems as if she was not careful about what she was careful, or because her husband all -consuming activities did not leave anything to her share, or because she belonged, in terms of its very complication, to that philosophical category of people who, having feelings and feelings of feelings and feelings of feelings. , both thoughts and mind, live in half, look at life in the eyes and, seeing outrageous anxieties and struggles, they say: “<may they, fools, are furious! They are worse. "

- Hello, sister! - said Platonov. - Where is Konstantin?

- Don't know. He should have been here for a long time. True, slammed.

Chichikov did not turn to the mistress <attention>. He was interested in considering the dwelling of this extraordinary person. He thought to find the properties of the owner himself in him - as a sink can be judged by what kind of oyster or snail sat in her. But this was not. The rooms were completely spacious - spacious, and nothing more. No frescoes, no paintings on the walls, no bronze on the tables, nor a floor with porcelain or cups, neither vases, nor flowers, nor statues-in a word, somehow a head. Simple ordinary furniture and the piano stood aside, and he was covered with dust: apparently, the hostess rarely sat down for him. From the living room, there was a door to the owner’s office>; [95] But it was the same there - simply and a head. It was evident that the owner came to the house only to relax, and not to live in it; That for the thought of his plans and thoughts he did not need a cabinet with spring chairs and all sorts of deceased amenities and that his life was not in charming dreams of a flaming fireplace, but right in business. The thought suddenly proceeded from the circumstances, at the moment they imagined, and suddenly turned into business, having no need to be recorded.

- A! here he is! Come, goes! - said Platonov.

Chichikov also rushed to the window. The porch was approaching the forty years old, lively, dark -skinned appearance. He was wearing a triple cartoon. On both sides of him, taking off their hats, two lower classes walked,-they walked, talking and interpreting about something with him. One seemed to be a simple man; Another, in the blue Siberian, some kind of visor and rogue.

- So order, father, accept! - said the man, bowing.

- No, brother, I repeated to you twenty times: do not take anymore. My material has accumulated so much that there is nowhere to put it.

- Yes, you, Father Konstantin Fedorovich, will go into business. A kind of smart person in the whole world cannot be found. Your health will put any thing in a place. So order to accept.

- I, brother, need my hands; Deliver the workers to me, not the material.

- Yes, you will not have a shortage of workers. We will go into work whole villages: we will not remember the freezure that we will not remember. The trouble is that you don’t want to take us at all, but they would have served you, by golly, have been served. You will learn every mind, Konstantin Fedorovich. So order to accept for the last time.

- Why, then you said: for the last time, but after all, you brought again.

- For the last time, Konstantin Fedorovich. If you do not take, then no one will take from me. So order, Father, to accept.

- Well, listen, I’ll take this time, and then out of regret only so that it does not escape in vain. But if you bring another time, at least three weeks, I will not take it.

-I listen, sir, Konstantin Fedorovich; Be rest, another time I won’t bring it. Thank you submissively. - The man walked away, pleased. He lies, however, bring: maybe a great word.

“So, sir, Konstantin Fedorovich, make mercy ... Britten,” said the visiting fist in the blue Siberka, who was walking on the other side.

- After all, I at first announced to you. I am not a hunter to bargain. I tell you again: I'm not like another landowner to whom you will drive up to the lumbar. After all, I know you all. You have lists of everyone who should be paid when. What is the wise? He will see him, he will give you at half the price. And what is your money to me? I have a thing for at least three years! I don't need to pay at the pawnshop ...

- The present business, Konstantin Fedorovich. Why, I’m the same ... because only in order to continue to have a touch with you, and not for the sake of self-interest. If you please accept three thousand sets.

The fist took out the bunch of the bunch of greasy banknotes from his bosom. Kostanzhologlo Prachlad -blooded took them and, not counting, put his frock coat in the back pocket of his coat.

“Um, Chichikov thought,“ just like a handkerchief! ”

A minute later Kostanzhoglo appeared at the doorway of the living room.

- Ba, brother, you're here! He said, seeing Platonov. They hugged and kissed. Platonov recommended Chichikov. Chichikov reverently approached the owner, she kissed him on his cheek, taking a kiss from him.

Kostanzhoglo face was very wonderful. It was noticeable in the southern origin. The hair on the head and eyebrows is dark and thick, speaking eyes, the splendor of the strong. The mind sparkled in any expression, and there was nothing sleepy in him. But it was noticeable, however, there was an admixture of something biliary and embittered. What, in fact, was he a nation? There are many in Rus' of Russian non -Russian origin, in the soul, however, Russians. Kostanzhoglo did not engage in his origin, finding that this is not in the line and in the household the thing is superfluous. Moreover, I did not know another language other than Russian.

- Do you know, Konstantin, what did I invent? - said Platonov.

- And what?

- I invented to go through different provinces; Perhaps this will cure the spleen.

- Well? It can very well be.

- Here are with Pavel Ivanovich.

- Wonderful! In what places, ”asked Kostanzhoglo, converting to Chichikov affably,“ are you supposed to go now? ”

“I admit,” Chichikov said, tilting his head to one side and holding the handle of the chairs with his hand, “I’m going to eat, not so much in need, but for the need of another.” General Betrishchev, a close friend and, one might say, a philanthropist, asked to visit relatives. Relatives, of course, are relatives, but partly, so to speak, for themselves; Because, for sure, not to mention the benefits that can be in a hemorrhoidal attitude, one thing is already to see the light, the flimming of people ... Whoever you say, there is, so to speak, a living book, the same science.

- Yes, it does not bother to look into other corners.

“It was excellent to notice,” Chichikov reacted, “for sure, it does not interfere.” You see things that I would not see; You meet people whom you would not meet. The conversation with the other is the same Chervonets. Teach the most venerable Konstantin Fedorovich, teach, I am resorting to you. I am waiting for manna, your sweet words.

Kostanzhoglo was embarrassed.

- What, however? .. What to teach? I myself studied with copper money.

- Wisdom, respectable, wisdom! wisdom to manage the economy, like you; Like you, to be able to extract true income; The acquisition, like you, is not a dreamy property, but essential, and thereby fulfill the duty of a citizen, to earn the respect of compatriots.

- Do you know what? - said Kostanzhoglo, - stay with me. I will show you all management and tell you about everything. There is no wisdom here, as you see.

“Brother, stay this day,” said the hostess, addressing Platonova.

“Perhaps I don’t care,” he said indifferently, “like Pavel Ivanovich?”

- Me too, I am with great pleasure ... But the circumstance - you need to visit a relative of General Betrishchev. There is someone Colonel Koshkarev ...

“But he ... do you know that?” After all, he is a fool and obsessed.

- I have already heard about this. I don’t care about him. But since General Betrishchev is a close friend and, even so to speak, a philanthropist ... It’s so awkward.

“In that case, you know what,” said <Kostanzhoglo>, “go to him now.” I have finished spans. To him and ten miles, so you fly in spirit. You will even go back before dinner.

Chichikov was happy to use the offer. The spans were served, and he went the same hour to the colonel, who amazed him as he had never happened to be amazed. Everything was unusually at the colonel. The whole village was a frame: buildings, perestroika, heaps of lime, brick and logs through all the streets. Some kind of houses like public places were built. In one it was written in gold letters: “Depot of agricultural guns”, on the other: “Home counting expedition”, on the third: “Committee of rural affairs”; “The school of normal enlightenment of the settlement,” in a word, the devil knows what was not there! He thought if he entered the provincial city. The colonel himself was some kind of jerking. The face is some kind of richen in the form of a triangle. Bacenbard on his cheeks were stretched into a string; Hair, hairstyle, nose, lips, chin - everything seemed to lie under the press. He began to speak, as it were, a good man. From the first, he began to complain to him to complain about the non -education of the surrounding landowners, about the great works that he will face. He accepted Chichikov perfectly affectionately and cordially, introduced him completely into a power of attorney and told him with self -sending how many and how much he cost him the work of the estate to the current well -being; How difficult it was to make it clear to a simple man that there are higher motives that give a person an enlightened luxury, art and art; How much it was necessary to fight the ignorance of the Russian man in order to put him in German pants and force him to feel, although some, the highest dignity of a person; that the women, despite all efforts, he still could not force the corset, while in Germany, where he stood with the regiment in the 14th year, the miller’s daughter knew how to play even on the piano, she said in French and did it and did Knicksen. He told with condolences how great the non -education of the neighbors of the landowners; How little they think about their subjects; How they even laughed when he tried to explain how it was necessary for the farm to organize a written office, the office of the commission and even committees in order to protect all thefts and any thing would be known for the clerk, the ruler and the accountant would not be formed somehow, but would graduate university education; As, despite all the beliefs, he could not convince the landlords that no matter what the benefit of their estates were if every peasant was brought up so that, following the plow, he could read a book about thunderous discharge at the same time.

To this, Chichikov <thought>: “Well, it is unlikely that such a time will choose. So I learned literacy, and the “Countess Lavalier” has not yet been read. ”

- A terrible ignorance! - said Colonel Koshkarev in conclusion. - Darkness of the Middle Ages, and there is no means to help ... Believe me, no! And I could help everything; I know one remedy, the right remedy.

- Which?

- To put on all to one in Russia, as they go in Germany. Nothing more, as soon as this, and I vouch for you that everything will go like clockwork: science will rise, trade will rise, the Golden Age will come in Russia.

Chichikov looked at him intently and thought: “Well? There seems to be nothing to repair with this. ” Without putting things in the distant box, he explained to the colonel right there, which is so and so: there is a need for what souls, with the perfect such fortresses.

“How much can I see from your words,” said the colonel, not at all embarrassed, “this is a request;” is not it?

- Yes sir.

- In that case, set it out in writing. She will go to the commission of all kinds of petitions. The commission of all kinds of petitions, marking it, leads it to me. She will enter the rural committee from me, there they will make all sorts of certificates and bearing in this case. The chief manager, together with the office, will put his resolution in his self -sophisticated time, and the case will be done.

Chichikov dumbfounded.

“Let me,” he said <he>, “that thing will drag on.”

- A! -the colonel said with a smile,-This is the benefit of paper production! It, for sure, will drag it somewhat, but nothing will slip away: every little thing will be visible.

“But let me ... How to interpret this in writing?” After all, this is such a thing ... After all, the soul in some way ... dead.

- Very good. You write so that souls in some way ... dead.

“But how are the dead?” After all, this one cannot write. Although they are dead, it is necessary that they seem to be alive.

- Fine. You write so: "But it is necessary, or it is required to seem to seem like alive."

What was to do with the colonel? Chichikov decided to go to see what these were commissions and committees; And what he found there was not only amazing, but decisively exceeded any understanding. The commission of all kinds of petitions existed only on the sign. Its chairman, the former valet, was transferred to the newly formed committee of rural buildings. His place was interceded by the office of Timoshka, seconded to the investigation - to disassemble the drinker with the clerk with the headman, fraudster and rogue. The official is nowhere.

-But where is it? .. But how to achieve some kind of sense? - Chichikov said to his sonnail, an official on special assignments, whom the colonel gave him to the conductors.

“You won’t get any use,” said the conductor, “we have a stupid.” We have to see everything, disperses the construction commission, tears everyone from the case, sends the kuda. It is only beneficial with us, in the construction commission. - He, apparently, was dissatisfied with the construction commission. - We have so started that everyone leads the master’s nose. He thinks that everything as it should, but this is only one name.

“This, however, needs to tell him,” Chichikov thought, and, having come to the colonel, announced that he had porridge and could not be achieved, and the construction commission steals over.

The colonel was waxed with noble indignation. Immediately, grabbing the paper and the feather, wrote eight strict requests: on what basis did the construction commission of self -right disposed of officials impending it? How could the chief manager allow the chairman, without giving up his post, go to the investigation? And how could the agricultural committee indifferently could see that there is not even a petition commission?

“Well, Kuterma will go,” thought Chichikov and began to bow.

- No, I will not let you go. At two o’clock, no more, you will be satisfied in everything. I will now entrust your business to a special person who has just graduated from a university course. Sit in my library. Here everything that you need for you: books, paper, feathers, pencils - everything. Use, use everything - you are sir.

So Koshkarev said, introducing him into the book depository. It was a huge hall, tired of books from top to bottom. There were even animals stuffed there. Books on all parts - in terms of forestry, cattle breeding, pig farming, gardening, thousands of all kinds of magazines, manuals and many magazines representing the latest development and improvements both in equestrian and natural sciences. There were also such names: "Pigging as a science." Seeing that there are things that were not pleasant to bring <time>, he turned to another closet. From the fire - to the driving. There were all the books of philosophy. On one there was a title: “Philosophy, in the sense of science”; Six volumes in a row under the name: "Pre -preparation entry to the theory of thinking in their community, combination, essence and in the application to the usteting of organic principles of mutual bifurcation of social productivity." Whatever Chichikov turned the book, on every page - manifestation, developing, abstract, isolation and closed, and the devil knows what was not there. “No, this is not for me,” Chichikov said and turned to the third closet, where there were books all in terms of arts. Then he pulled out some huge book with immodest mythological pictures and began to consider them. It was to his taste. Bachelors of medium <years old ”like this kind of pictures. They say that recently they began to like even the old people who sophisticated taste on ballets. Well, to do, humanity of our century loves spicy roots. Having finished the examination of this book, Chichikov pulled out another way, when Colonel Koshkarev, with a radiant look and paper, suddenly appeared.

- Everything is done, and done perfectly. This man decisively understands one for everyone. For this, I will put it above all: I will start a special, higher administration and put it as president. That's what he writes ...

“Well, glory to those Lord,” thought Chichikov and prepared to listen. The colonel began to read:

- “Starting the thought of the assignment entrusted to me, I have the honor to convey this to it: 1) In the very request of the Mr. College Advisor and Cavalier Pavel Ivanovich Chichikov, there is already some misunderstanding: in the explanation of the fact that revisial souls are required, comprehended by all sorts of suddens, comprehended. Inserted and the dead. Under Sim, they probably deigned to understand close to death, and not dead; For the dead are not acquired. Well, and to purchase if there is nothing? This is evidenced by the very logic. And in the verbal sciences, they, apparently, did not go far ... ” - here for a minute Koshkarev stopped and said:“ In this place, rogue ... He pricked you a little. But judge, however, what a lively feather-the state-secretary syllable; But for only three years I stayed at the university, did not even finish the course. - Koshkarev continued: “... in the verbal sciences, apparently, not far away ... for the dead were expressed about the souls, while everyone who studied the course of human knowledge, it is flush that the soul is immortal. 2) these mentioned revision souls, newcomers, or profitable, or, as they misunderstood the dead, there are no one that would not be in the pledge, because all in the aggregate are not only laid without seizure, but also re -raised, with an increase in according to One and a half hundred rubles per soul, except for the small village of Gurmailovka, in a controversial position on the occasion of litigation with the landowner Predashchev, and therefore can not go on sale or bail. ”

“So why didn’t you announce this to me before?” Why did they keep from trifles? - said Chichikov with his heart.

“Why, how could I know about it at first?” This is the benefit of paper production, that now everything, as in the palm, turned out to be clear.

“You are a fool, stupid cattle! - Chichikov thought to himself. - I dug in the books, and what did you learn? ” Past of all kinds of courtesies and decency, he grabbed a hat - from the house. The coachman stood, the flights were ready and did not postpone the horses: a written request would go about the stern, and the resolution - to give the oats to the horses - would only come out the next day. No matter how rude Chichikov was, but Koshkarev, despite everything, was unusually courting him and delicate. He forcibly shook his hand, and pressed it to his heart, and thanked him for giving him an opportunity to see in practice the course of production; that the trouble and the race need to be given, because everything is able to doze off and the springs of the rural management will rust and weaken; That as a result of this event, a happy thought came to him: to arrange a new commission, which will be called a commission of observing the construction commission, so then no one will dare to steal.

"Donkey! fool!" Thought Chichikov, angry and dissatisfied with the whole way. He rode already at the stars. The night was in the sky. There were lights in the villages. Arriving to the porch, he saw in the windows that the table was already set for dinner.

- Why are you so late? - said Kostanzhoglo when he appeared in the doorway.

“What have you been talking about for so long with him?” - said Platonov.

- Said! - said Chichikov. - I still have not seen a sort of older.

- This is nothing! - said Kostanzhoglo. - Koshkarev is a comforting phenomenon. Then it is needed, which is reflected in caricature and more visible the stupidity of smart people. The offices and the presence of managers, and manufactories, and factories, and schools, and the commission, and the devil know what it is. As if they had a state! How do you like it? I'm asking. The landowner, who has arable land and lacks peasants to cultivate, and he started the candle factory, wrote out the candlesticks from London, became a bargain! There is another fool even better: he started a factory of silk matter!

“Why, you have factories,” said Platonov.

- And who started them? They themselves started up: the wool has accumulated, there is nowhere to sell, and I began to weave cloth, and cloth is thick, simple; At a cheap price, they are immediately disassembled in the markets. The fish husk, for example, was dropped by my shore for six years in a row; Well, to put her? I began to cook glue from her, but forty thousand and took it. After all, everything is so for me.

“Esko the devil! - Thought Chichikov, looking at him in both eyes, - a thoroughly what a paw! "

- Yes, I do not build buildings for this; I have no buildings with columns and pediments. I do not write out the masters from abroad. And I will never tear the peasants from the tires. In factories, they work only in a hungry year, all came, because of a piece of bread. There will be many such factories. Consider only your economy more later, you will see - every rag will go into business, all rubbish will give income, so then you repel, you only say: you don’t need to.

- This is amazing! The most amazing thing is that all rubbish will give income! - said Chichikov.

- Um! Yes, not only that! .. - Kostanzhoglo did not finish: the bile in it awakened, and he wanted to choose the neighbors of the landowners. - There is one wise guy again - what do you think at yourself? Ground -sized establishments, stone structure in the village! Christ -loving business! .. You want to help, so you help everyone fulfill this duty, and do not tear it away from Christian duty. Help your son warm his sick father, and do not give him the opportunity to throw him off his shoulders. Give him better the means to shelter in your neighbor and brother, give him money for it, help with all his might, and do not excommunicate him: he will completely lag behind any Christian duties. Don Chischs are simply in all parts! .. Two hundred rubles goes to a person in a thorough institution! .. Yes, I will keep ten people in my village for this money! - Kostanzholo was angry and spat.

Chichikov was not interested in a thiletress: he wanted to talk about how all rubbish gives income. But Kostanzhoglo was already angry, the bile in it boiled, and the words poured.

-And here is another Don Chica of Enlightenment: I started schools! Well, what, for example, is more useful for a person, as a knowledge of literacy? But how did you manage? After all, men from his village come to me. “What is it, they say, Father, such? Our sons have completely fought back, they don’t want to help in the works, everyone wants to be in the clerk, but the clerk needs one. ” After all, this is what happened!

Chichikov also did not need schools, but Platonov picked up this subject:

- Why, there is nothing to stop, that now the clerk is not needed: after there will be a need. You need to work for offspring.

- Yes, be, brother, even though you are smart! Well, what did you give this offspring? Everyone thinks that they are some Petra great. Yes, you look at your feet, and do not look into offspring; The trouble is to make a man enough and rich, so that he had time to study by his hunt, and not just saying with a stick in his hand: “Learn!” The devil knows at which they start with the end! .. Well, listen: well, here I am to the trial ... - then Kostanzholo moved closer to Chichikov and, to make him get into the case, took it for boarding, in other words - put his finger in the finger The loop of his tailcoat. - Well, what could be clearer? You have peasants then so that you patronize them in their peasant life. What is the way of life? What are the activities of the peasant? In the tower? So try that he is a good stoop. Clear? No, there were wise men, they say: “It needs to be withdrawn from this fortune. He leads too rude, simple life: you need to introduce him to the objects of luxury. " That, thanks to this luxury, rags, and not people, and the devil knows which the devil who climbed, and there is no OsmoEne -year -old boy who would not have tried everything: he has no teeth and bald, so they want to infect these now. Yes, thank God that we still have one more healthy estate that did not meet these whims! For this, we just have to thank God. Yes, the farmers are more respectable to me for all. God forbid, that everyone is for the adversary!

- So do you believe that it is more profitable to deal with the tutrans? - asked Chichikov.

- Legal, not what is more profitable. Cultivate the earth in the sweat of your face. This is told to us all; It is not without reason that it is said. The experience of centuries has already been proven that in an agricultural title, man is cleaner than mores. Where the tape lay down on the foundation of the household, there is abundance and contentment; There is no poverty, there is no luxury, but there is contentment. Thinking the earth - the person is said, work ... What is there to cunning! I say to the man: “Whoever you work, whether to me, to yourself, a neighbor, just work. In the activity I am your first assistant. You don’t have cattle, here you have a horse, here is a cow, here you have a cart ... Everyone you need is ready to provide you, but work. For me, death, if your farm is not in the device and I see your mess and poverty. I will not suffer idleness. Then I am above you so that you work. ” Um! They think to increase income by managers and factories! Yes, you think before that every man is rich in you, so then you yourself will be rich without factories, and without factories, and without stupid <stes>.

“The more you listen to you, the most respectable Konstantin Fedorovich,” said Chichikov, “the more you get a desire to listen.” Tell me, I venerate: if, for example, I had the intention to become a landowner, let's put it, the local province, what to mostly pay attention to? What to do, what to do in order to get rich in a short "time" in order to fulfill a significant obligation of a citizen, so to speak?

- What to do to get rich? But how ... ”said Kostanzholo.

- Let's go dinner! - said the hostess, rising from the couch, and performed in the middle of the room, wiping young members, who had, twisted into a shawl.

Chichikov grabbed from a chair with the dexterity of an almost military man, flew up to the mistress with a soft expression in a smile of a delicate civilian man, put her hand in a rocker and led her to the dining room two rooms, while maintaining a pleasant mood of her head a little to one side. The minister removed the lid from the soup cup; All with chairs moved closer to the table, and the soup began to begin.

Having finished the soup and washed down a glass of filing (the filing was excellent), Chichikov said so Kostanzhoglu:

- Let me, the most respectable, again turn you to the subject of a terminated conversation. I asked you about what to do, what to do, how best to get ... [96]

. . . . . .

- The estate, for which if he requested forty thousand, I would immediately count him.

- Um! - Chichikov thought. “But why are you yourself,” he said with some timidity, “do not buy it?”

- Yes, you need to know finally the limits. I already have a lot of trouble near my estates. Moreover, the nobles already shout at me, as if I, using the extremes and their positions ruined, buy the lands for nothing. I am finally tired of it.

- The nobility is capable of slander! - said Chichikov.

- And already with us, in our province ... You cannot imagine what they are talking about me. They do not call me differently, as a berth and scum the first degree. They excuse themselves in everything. “I say, of course, I was scrained, but because I lived the highest needs of life. I need books, I have to live luxuriously, so that industry is encouraged; And this way, perhaps, you can live and without a ruin if they had to live such a pig as Kostanzhoglo. ” After all, how!

- I would like to be a kind of pig! - said Chichikov.

- And after all, this is all because I do not set dinners and do not take money to them. I don’t give dinner that I would have burden, I am not used to it. And come to me there is what I eat - we ask for mercy! I do not give money - this is nonsense. Come to me really in need, and tell me thoroughly how you will manage my money. If I see from your words that you will use it smartly and money will bring you a clear profit, I will not refuse you and will not even take interest. But I will not throw money into the drain. Let me apologize for this. He starts some dinner with his mistress or removes the house on a crazy leg on a crazy leg, and give him the money of loan! ..

Here Kostanzhoglo spat and almost spoke out a few indecent and swear words in the presence of his wife. The harsh shadow of dark hypochondria overshadowed his living face. The forehead and input of it gathered wrinkles, exposures of the angry motion of excited bile.

Chichikov drank a glass of raspberry and said this:

“Let me, venerable to me, turn you back to the subject of a terminated conversation.” If, we put it, I acquired the very estate that you deigned to mention, then how long and how soon you can get rich to such an extent ...

“If you want,” picked up a harshly and abruptly Kostanzhoglo, still a complete unusual spirit, “to get rich soon, so you will never get rich;” If you want to get rich without asking about time, then you will get rich soon.

- Here it is! - said Chichikov.

“Yes,” said Kostanjolo abruptly, exactly how he would be angry with Chichikov himself. - We must have a love of work; Without this, nothing can be done. It is necessary to love the economy, yes! And, believe me, this is not boring at all. They thought that in the village of Toska ... Yes, I would have died from longing, if at least one day I spent in the city as they spend! The owner does not have time to miss. In life, there is no emptiness - all fullness. It is only necessary to consider this whole diverse circle of annual classes - and what classes! lessons, truly exalting the spirit, not to mention diversity. Here a person goes next to nature, with the seasons, an accomplice and interlocutor to everything that is committed in a creation. Spring has not yet appeared, and work is conceived: transportation and firewood, and all for a time of the risk; seed preparation; bulkhead, gravy on the barns of bread and overdings; Equipment of new grows. Snow and rivers passed - work suddenly will be boiled: there are loading on ships, here is clearing wood through the forests, transplanting wood through the gardens, and went to blow the ground everywhere. There is a margin in the gardens, in the fields - Soha and the harrow. And crops begin. Trifle! The future crop is sown! Summer has come - mowing, the first holiday of the stoker. Trifle! The harvest will go behind the harvest: behind the rye wheat, behind the barley oats, and then the jerking of hemp. They tossed the stacks, put the pods. And then Augustes exceeded half - the boom went on the threshing floor. Autumn has come - smells and crops of winter breads, chink barns, rigs, cattle yards, bread experience and the first loud. Winter will come - and then the work is not asleep: the first disposal to the city, the threshing of all the threshing grounds, the transportation of ground bread from Rig to barn, the forests and the spray of firewood, the brick and the material for spring buildings. Yes, I just do not hug everything in a state. What a variety of works! You go here and go there: both at the mill, and at the work of the courtyard, and in the factories, and on the threshold! You go to a man to look at how he works for himself. Trifle! Yes, for me a holiday, if a carpenter owns a good ax; For two hours I am ready to stand before him: the work is so amusing me. And if you see also for what purpose all this is happening, how everything is multiplying around you and multiplying, bringing a fruit and income. Yes, I can’t tell you what pleasure. And not because money is growing - money with money, but because all this is the work of your hands; Because you see how you are all the reason and the creator of everything, and from you, like from some magician, is spraying an abundant and good for everything. Where will you find me equal pleasure? - said Kostanzhoglo, and his face rose up, all the wrinkles disappeared. Like the king on his solemn wedding day, he shone. - Yes, in the whole world, you will not find such pleasure! Here, it was here that man imitates God: God left himself the work of creativity, as the highest pleasure, and also requires man to be the creator of prosperity and harmonious tenders of deeds. And this is called a boring business!

Like the stumps of a paradise bird, Chichikov heard sweet -sounding master's speeches. They swallowed his lips. His eyes woke up and expressed sweetness, and he would have listened.

- Konstantin! It's time to get up, ”said the hostess, rising from the chair. Platonov raised himself, rose Kostanzhoglo, Chichikov raised himself, although he wanted to sit and listen to everything. Ending his hand in a rocker, he led the mistress back. But his head was not inclined to one side, lacked dexterity in his turns, because thoughts were busy with significant turns and considerations.

“Whatever you tell, but everything, however, is boring,” Platonov said, following them.

“The guest seems to be a very undead man,” the owner thought, “is sedentary in words and not a sloglkoper.” And, having thought so, he became even more fun, exactly how he himself was heated from his conversation and, as it were, celebrating that he found a person who was ready to listen to smart advice.

When then they all fit in a small, cozy room, illuminated by candles, having cooked the balcony glass door of the windows, Chichikov became as sheltered as it had never been. Just as if after long wandering was already accepted by his native roof and, according to the accomplishment, he had already received everything desired and threw a wandering staff, saying: “Enough!” Such a charming location brought him a reasonable conversation between the owner. There are such speeches for every person that, as it were, closer and relative to him other speeches. And often unexpectedly, in a deaf, forgotten background, on a deserted deserted, you will meet a person whom a heating conversation will make you forget the outright of the road, and the homelessness of the overnight stay, and modern light, full of stupidity of human, deceiting, deceiving man. And then, then the evening spent in this way will remain forever and forever, and everything that happened and was then holds the right memory: who was in contact, and who stood in what place, and what was in his hands - walls, corners and all kinds of trinket .

So Chichikov was noticed that evening: this small, unpretentious decorated room, and a good -natured expression that reigned in the face of the owner, and Platonov’s pipe with an amber mouthpiece, and the smoke that he began to let Yarbu’s thick face, and the snout of the Yarba, and the sniffing of Yarba, and the laughter of a pretty housewife, interrupted by the words: “Full, do not torment him,” - and cheerful candles, and cricket in the corner, and a glass door, and a spring night that looked at them, leaning on the tops of the trees, from whose thickets the spring Nightingale.

“My speeches, Konstantin Fedorovich, who is my speech, is sweet to me,” said Chichikov. - I can say that I have not met in all of Russia a person like you according to the mind.

He smiled.

“No, Pavel Ivanovich,” he said, “if you want to know a smart person, so we really have one, about which, for sure, we can say:“ Smart person ”, whom I do not stand on the on -scenes.

- Who is this? - Chichikov asked with amazement.

- This is our incident Murazov.

- For another time I hear about him! - cried out Chichikov.

“This is a person who is not like the landowner’s own, he will control the whole state.” If I had a state, I would have made him this hour as Minister of Finance.

- Heard. They say that a person who is superior to the measure of any likelihood, ten million, they say, made it.

- What ten! Passed forty. Soon half of Russia will be in his hands.

- What are you saying! - cried out Chichikov, dumbfounded.

- All -in. He should now be increasing with the speed of incredible. It is clear. Only one who has some hundreds of thousands is slowly rich; And who has millions, the radius is great: whatever captures, so half and three times against himself. The field is too spacious. There are no rivals. There is no one to compete with him. Whatever price will be prescribed, this will remain: there is no one to kill.

Having shook his eyes and licked his mouth, as if dug, Chichikov looked into the eyes of Kostanzhoglo. I took a breath in his chest.

- The mind is incomprehensible! He said, recovering a little. - the thought from fear stones. The wisdom of fishing in the examination of the bukashka are amazed; For me, it is more amazing that such enormous amounts can contact in the hands of the mortal! Let me offer you a question about one circumstance; Tell me, is it, of course, at first acquired not without sin?

- The most impeccable way and the most fair means.

- I won’t believe it, the most venerable, sorry, I won’t believe it. If these were thousands, it would be so, but millions ... Sorry, I won’t believe it.

- On the contrary, thousands are difficult without sin, and millions are easily profitable. The millionaire has nothing to resort to the crooked tracks. Straightly, the road go, take it all, whatever lies in front of you! The other will not raise.

- The mind is incomprehensible! And what is all incomprehensible, this is that the matter began from a penny!

- Yes, it does not happen otherwise. This is the legal order of things, ”said Kostanzhoglo. - Who was born with thousands, brought up on thousands, he will not acquire: he already had a whim, and you never know anything! You need to start from the beginning, not from the middle. From below, below you need to start. Here you will only find out well people and life, among which you will have to dodge later. As you wipe it on your own skin, and how to find out that every penny is nailed with an altin nail, but how you cross all the ordeals, then you will wise and the abuslets <so> that you won’t give a miss and you won’t break into any way. Believe me, this is true. From the beginning you need to start, not from the middle. Who tells me: “Give me one hundred thousand, I’m getting rich now,” I won’t believe it: he beats at random, and not for sure. You need to start with a penny!

“In that case, I get rich,” said Chichikov, “because I start almost, so to speak, with nothing.”

He understood dead souls.

“Konstantin, it's time to give Pavel Ivanovich a rest and sleep,” said the hostess, “and you are chatting.”

“And you will certainly get rich,” said Kostanjolo, not listening to the hostess. - Rivers, rivers of gold will flow to you. You will not know where to put income.

As a fascinated, Pavel Ivanovich sat, and in the golden area of ​​increasing dreams and dreams his thoughts spun.

- Right, Konstantin, Pavel Ivanovich is time to sleep.

- What do you need? Well, go, if you wanted to! - the owner said and stopped: loudly, Platonov snoring throughout the room, and after him the yoke snored even louder. For a long time, a distant knock in cast -iron boards was heard. The case pulled after midnight. Kostanzhoglo noticed that it was really time to rest. Everyone scattered, wishing a calm sleep to each other, and did not slow down to use it.

One Chichikov just could not sleep. His thoughts were awake. He pondered how to become a landowner like Kostanzhoglo. After a conversation with the owner, everything became so clear; The opportunity to get rich seemed so obvious. The difficult business of the economy was now so easily and clearly seemed to be characteristic of its nature itself that he began to think of the acquisition of an not imaginary, but real estate; He immediately determined the money that would be given to him from the pawnshop for fantastic souls, to get the estate is no longer fantastic. He already saw himself acting and ruling exactly as he taught Kostanzhoglo, - with a quick, carefully, not starting nothing, without knowing everything through the old one, having seen everything with his own eyes, having learned all the men, having pushed away all the excesses, giving himself only to work and farm. He was already looking forward to the pleasure that he would feel when the slender order starts and all the springs of the economy will move by a lively passage, actively pushing each other. Labor will boil, and, like that <How> in a layer of mill, flour flows out of the grain, it will go to beg for all signs and the trash is clean and clean. The wonderful owner stood in front of him every minute. This was the first person in all of Russia, to whom he felt personal respect. He had a hitherto respected a man either for a good rank, or for large prosperity! Actually, he has not yet respected a single person for the mind. Kostanzhoglo was the first. Chichikov also realized that with a sort of nothing to interpret about dead souls and the very question of this will be inappropriate. It was now occupied by another project - to buy the estate of Chlobuev. He had ten thousand: he intended toar the other ten thousand from Kostanzhoglo, since he himself already announced that he was ready to help everyone, who wanted to get rich and engage in economy. The remaining ten thousand could be obliged later, to launch souls. It was still impossible to lay all the stuffed souls, because there were still no lands on which they should be relocated. Although <assured> he in the Kherson province has lands, but they existed more in assumption. It was also supposed to buy them in the Kherson province, because they were sold there for nothing and even surrendered for nothing, if only they would settle on them. He also thought that it was necessary to rush to buy, who else have fugitives and dead people, for the landowners are in a hurry to lay estates in front of each other and soon there may not be a corner not laid down in the treasury in the whole Russia. All these thoughts alternately filled his head and interfered with sleep. Finally, the dream, which for four hours held the whole house, as they say, in his arms, finally took Chichikov in his arms. He fell asleep tightly.

Chapter Four

The next day, everything was the best. Kostanzhoglo gave with joy ten thousand without percent, without guarantee - just for one receipt. So he was ready to help everyone in the way to the acquisition. This is not enough: he himself undertook to accompany Chichikov to Chlobuev in order to inspect the estate with him. After a hearty breakfast, they all went, all three to the stroller Pavel Ivanovich; The hosts of the owner followed the emptyness of them. Yarb fled in front, driving birds from the road. At an hour and a half with a little they made eighteen miles and saw a village with two houses. One large and new, unfinished and remained in black years, the other is small and old. They found the owner disheveled, sleepy, recently awakened; He had a patch on a frock coat, and on his boot a hole.

He was delighted with the arrival of guests, as God the news of something. Just as if he saw the brothers, with whom he broke up for a long time.

- Konstantin Fedorovich! Platon Mikhailovich! He cried out. - Fathers are relatives! So leaned! Give me wipe your eyes! I really thought that no one would come to me. Everyone runs me like plague: he thinks - I will ask for a loan. Oh, difficult, difficult, Konstantin Fedorovich! I see - the fault is all! What to do? Pig pigs healed. Sorry, gentlemen, that I accept you in this outfit: boots, as you see, with holes. What is you to treat you, tell me?

- Please, without outskirts. We came to you for business, ”said Kostanzhoglo. - Here is the buyer, Pavel Ivanovich Chichikov.

- Swentrally glad to meet. Let me press your hand.

Chichikov gave him both.

- I would like very, the most venerable Pavel Ivanovich, to show you the estate worth attention ... But what, gentlemen, let me ask, have you lunch?

“We had lunch, dined,” said Kostanjolo, wanting to get off. - We will not put it on and let's go now.

- In that case, let's go.

Khlobuev picked up a cartoon. The guests put on the heads of the cartules, and everyone went on foot to inspect the village.

“Let's go to inspect my riots and my disorder,” said Chlobuev. - Of course, you did well that you had lunch. Believe it, Konstantin Fedorovich, there is no chicken in the house - before that he lived. Pig himself behave, just a pig!

He, taking a deep breath and, as it were, feeling that there would be little participation from Konstantin Fedorovich and his heart was harsh, grabbed Platonov’s arm and went forward with him, pressing him tightly to his chest. Kostanzhoglo and Chichikov was left behind and, holding their arms, followed them in the distance.

- Difficult, Plato Mikhalych, hard! - said Chlobuev Platonov. - You can’t imagine how difficult it is! Beznajesty, Bright, Bessaposye! Tryn-grass would all be if it were young and alone. But when all these hardships will break you under old age, and at the side of a wife, five children, - will be grouped, involuntarily will be grouped ...

Platonov felt sorry.

- Well, if you sell the village, will it correct you? - he asked.

- What will it correct! - said Khlobuev, waving his hand. - Everything will go on payment of the necessary debts, and then there will be no thousands left for himself.

- So what will you do?

“But God knows,” said Chlobuev, shrugging his shoulders.

Platonov was surprised.

- How do you do nothing to get out of such circumstances?

- What to do?

- As if there are no funds?

- No.

-Well, look for positions, take some place.

- After all, I am a provincial secretary. What can I give me a profitable place? The salary will give insignificant, but I have a wife, five children.

-Well, a private position. Go to the managers.

- But who will believe the estate! I squeezed my own.

-Well, so if hunger and death threaten, it is necessary to do something. I will ask if my brother can exhaust any position through anyone in the city.

“No, Platon Mikhailovich,” said Khlobuev, sighing and tightening his hand tightly, “I am now not good.” It was pretty old of his old age, and the lower back hurts from previous sins, and rheumatism in the shoulder. Kuda to me! What to ruin the treasury! And without that, there are now many employees for the sake of profitable places. God keep that because of me, because of the delivery, the salary was added to me to the poor class: already it is difficult for him to be difficult for many sucking. No, Platon Mikhailovich, God with him.

“Here's the situation! - thought Platonov. “This is worse than my hibernation.”

Meanwhile, Kostanzhoglo and Chichikov, walking behind them at a decent distance, so they said: they said:

- Over launched like everyone else! - said Kostanzhoglo, pointing his finger. - He brought a man to what poverty! When the case happened, there’s nothing to look at your good. Here you sell all your own, but provide a man with a cattle so that he does not remain and one days without means to work. But now you can’t correct it for years: and the man has already exped to, and walked, and became a drunkard.

- So, therefore, now it’s not entirely profitable and buying a kind of estate? - asked Chichikov.

Then Kostanzholo looked at him as he wanted to say to him: “What kind of ignoramus you are! From the alphabet, or something, do you need to start with you? "

- Unprofitable! Yes, three years later I will receive twenty thousand annual income from this name. Here it is as unprofitable! Fifteen miles. Trifle! And what is the earth? Look at the Earth! All semi -dedicated places. Yes, I will sow linen, and I will let the flash be felne for five one; I’ll put on a turnip - I will help out about thousands of four on the Repe. And look at - rye rose along the slope; After all, this is all carrion. He did not sow bread - I know that. Yes, this name is one and a half thousand thousand, not forty.

Chichikov began to fear so that Khlobuev would not hear, and therefore lagged for even further.

- Won how much land he left in all! - He said, starting to be angry, Kostanzhoglo. - If only I would have ahead, the hunters would have come across. Well, if there is nothing to plow, then dig under the garden. I would take a garden. The man forced to stay for four years without difficulty. Trifle! Why, you have already corrupted him with this and destroyed him forever. He managed to get used to the rag and vagrancy! It has already become his life. - And, saying this, he spat Kostanzhoglo, and the biliary location dawned on his gloomy cloud of his brow ...

“I can’t stay here anymore: I can look at this mess and desolation!” You can now end him without me. Take a treasure from this fool as soon as possible. He only dishonors God's gift!

And, saying this, Kostanzhoglo said goodbye to Chichikov and, having caught up with the owner, began to say goodbye.

“Have mercy, Konstantin Fedorovich,” said the surprised owner, “just arrived - and back!”

- I can not. I have an extreme need to be at home, ”said Kostanzhoglo, said goodbye, sat down and left on his spans.

It seemed that Khlobuev seemed to realize the reason for his departure.

“Konstantin Fedorovich could not stand it,” he said. - I feel that it is not fun to such a master, what he is, to look at a kind of unclear management. Do you believe that I can’t, I can’t, Pavel Ivanovich ... that I almost did not sow bread this year! Like an honest person. There were no seeds, not to mention the fact that there was nothing to plow. Your brother, Plato Mikhalych, they say, an extraordinary owner; About Konstantin Fedorovich what can I say - this is Napoleon a kind. Often, right, I think: “Well, why is there so much mind in one head? Well, so that at least a drop of it is stupid in my stupid, if only to keep his house! I can’t know anything, I can’t do anything. ” Ah, Pavel Ivanovich, "take" at your disposal! Sorry most for me are the poor peasants. I feel that I did not know how to be ... [97] What do you order to do, I cannot be demanding and strict. Yes, and how could he accustom them to order when he himself was random! I would let them go away now, but somehow a Russian person is arranged, somehow he can’t do without a pureer ... And he will doze off, so he grinds.

“After all, this is exactly strange,” said Platonov, “why is it so that if you don’t look in all eyes behind a simple person, it will become both a drunkard and a villain?”

“From the lack of education,” Chichikov remarked.

“Well, God is why.” So we enlighten, but how do we live? I was at the university, and listened to lectures in all parts, and I didn’t only learn the art and order to live, but also learned more to the art more to earn money for all sorts of new sophistications and comforts, I got acquainted with such objects that need money . Is it that I studied stupidly? Only not: after all, other comrades. Maybe two or three people have removed real benefits to themselves, and even then, maybe that they were already smart, and others are only trying to find out what spoils health, and lures money. By God! After all, they only then came to study in order to applaud the professors, to give them rewards, and not to receive themselves from them. So out of the enlightenment, we will still choose what is more aggravated by; We will grab his appearance, but we will take him "not>. No, Pavel Ivanovich, we do not know how to live another, and why, by golly, I do not know.

“There should be reasons,” Chichikov said.

The deeply poor Chlobuev sighed and said this:

-Sometimes, right, it seems to me that a Russian person is some kind of missing person. There is no willpower, there is no courage to constancy. If you want to do everything - and you can’t. You think everything is - from tomorrow you will start a new life, from tomorrow you will take it for everything as it should, from tomorrow you will sit on a diet, - it didn’t happen at all: in the evening the same days is so that you only clap your eyes and the tongue does not turn on, like an owl, like an owl , sitting, looking at everyone, - everything is right and such.

“We need to keep prudence in reserve,” said Chichikov, “to confer every minute with prudence, to conduct a friendly conversation with him.”

- What! - said Chlobuev. - The right, it seems to me, we are not born for prudence. I do not believe that of us someone was prudent. If I see that the other even lives decently, collects and accumulates money, - I do not believe it! In old age and his devil will stop - then he will go down then suddenly! And everything is like this: and noble, and men, and enlightened, and unenlightened. There was a smart man: of nothing, he made one hundred thousand, and how he made one hundred thousand, it occurred to the dope to make a bath from champagne, and bought in champagne. But here we seem to have examined everything. There is nothing more. Do you want to look at the mill? However, there is no wheel in it, and the structure is no good.

- Well, to consider her! - said Chichikov.

- In that case, let's go home. - And they all directed their steps to the house.

On the return path there were the same views. An untidy mess showed off his urethra from everywhere. Everything was lowered and launched. Only a new puddle in the middle of the street increased. An angry woman, in an oily Deryuga, nailed a poor girl to half to death and scolded all the sides of all the devils. At a distance, two men looked with the stoic indifference at the anger of a drunken woman. One scratched his back in his back, the other yawned. Zevota was visible on buildings. The roofs also yawned. Platonov, looking at them, yawned. “My future is the property-men,” thought Chichikov, “a hole on a hole and a patch on a patch!” And for sure, on one hut, instead of the roof, lay the whole gate; The failed windows were supported by poles stuck on the Lord's barn. In a word, the Trishkin Kaftan system was introduced into the farm: the scrap and the phalda on the patch of the elbows were cut off.

They entered the rooms. Chichikov was somewhat struck by a mixture of poverty with some shiny trinkets of later luxury. In the midst of torn utensils and furniture are brand new bronze. Some Shakespeare was sitting on the inkwell; On the table lay a dandy -bone handle for scratching his own back. Khlobuev recommended that the mistress of his wife. She was at least where. In Moscow, I would not hit my face in <dirt ”. The dress on her was tasteful, in fashion. I loved to talk more about the city and about the theater that started there. It was clear that she loved the village even less than her husband, and that she yawned more than Platonov when she was left alone. Soon the room was filled with children, girls and boys. There were five of them. The sixth brought in his arms. Everyone was beautiful. Boys and girls are a sight for sore eyes. They were dressed cute and tastefully, they were frisky and cheerful. And from this it was even more sad to look at them. It would be better if they were dressed badly, in simple variegated skirts and shirts, ran around the yard and were no different from ordinary peasant children! The guest came to the mistress. The ladies went to their half. The children ran away after them. Men were left alone.

Chichikov started buying. According to the custom of all purchasers, at first he handed over the purchased estate. And, groaning him from all sides, he said:

- What will be your price?

- Do you see what? - said Chlobuev. - I won’t ask you dearly, and I don’t like it: it would be shameless on my part. I will also not hide from you that in my village of a hundred souls that are listed on revision, there are no fifty: others either died from an epidemic disease, or excommunicated, so you read them as if dead. That's why I ask you only thirty thousand.

- Well - thirty thousand! The estate is running, people are dead, and thirty thousand! Take twenty -five thousand.

- Pavel Ivanovich! I can lay it in a pawnshop of twenty -five thousand, do you understand this? Then I get twenty -five thousand and the estate with me. I sell only then that I need money soon, and when laying there was a wire, I would have to pay orders, and there is nothing to pay.

“Well, still take twenty-five thousand.”

Platonov became conscientiously for Chichikov.

“Buy, Pavel Ivanovich,” he said. - For the estate you can always give this <price>. If you do not give thirty thousand for him, my brother and I develop and buy.

Chichikov was scared ...

- Fine! - he said. - I give thirty thousand. Here are two thousand deposits I will give you now, eight thousand in a week, and the remaining twenty thousand in a month.

- No, Pavel Ivanovich, only on the condition that the money is as soon as possible. Now you give me fifteen thousand, at least, and the rest are no further, like in two weeks.

- Yes, there are no fifteen thousand! I have ten ten now. Let me collect.

That is, Chichikov lied: he had twenty thousand.

- No, please, Pavel Ivanovich! I say that I need fifteen thousand.

- Yes, right, five thousand are lacking. I don't know how to get it myself.

“I will take you,” Platonov picked up.

- Is it a kind! - Chichikov said and thought to himself: “And this, however, by the way, that he loan: in this case, tomorrow it will be possible to bring.” A box was brought from the stroller, and then ten thousand Chlobuev was removed from it; The remaining five thousand was promised to bring him tomorrow: that is, promised; It was supposed to bring three; Others later, in two or three days, and if possible, then a few more expire. Pavel Ivanovich somehow did not particularly like to let out the money from his hands. If I insisted the extreme need, then it seemed to him, it was better to give out money tomorrow, and not today. That is, he acted like all of us! After all, we are pleased to bring the petitioner. Let him rub his back in the front! As if you can’t wait for him! What does we care about the fact that, perhaps, every hour is dear to him and tolerate him because of his work! “Come, brother, tomorrow, and today I have once no time.”

- Where will you live after that? - asked Platonov Chlobuev. - Do you have another village?

- There are no villages, but I will move to the city. Nevertheless, it was not necessary to do it not for yourself, but for children. They will need teachers by the law of God, music, and dance. After all, in the village you cannot get it.

"There is no piece of bread, but wants to teach children a dance!" - thought Chichikov.

"Strange!" - thought Platonov.

“Well, we need to go to the deal with something,” said Chlobuev. - Hey, Kiryushka, bring, brother, a bottle of champagne.

"There is no piece of bread, but there is champagne!" - thought Chichikov.

Platonov did not know what to think.

Champagne was brought. They drank three glasses and amused. Chlobuev untied, became smart and sweet. The severity and jokes poured continuously in him. In his speeches there was so much knowledge of people and light! He saw many things so well and correctly, so accurately and cleverly outlined in the few words of the neighbors of the landowners, so he clearly saw the shortcomings and mistakes of everyone, he knew the story of the ruined bar so well - and why, and how, and why they went bankrupt, so original and accurately He knew how to convey their smallest habits that they were both completely charmed by his speeches and were ready to recognize him for the smartest person.

“Listen,” said Platonov, grabbing his hand, “like you, with such a mind, experience and knowledge of everyday life, cannot find funds to get out of your difficult situation?”

“There are funds,” Khlobuev said, and after that he unloaded them with a whole bunch of spotlights. All of them were ridiculous, so strange, so little out of the knowledge of people and light that it remained only to shrug and say: “Lord God! What an immense distance between the knowledge of the light and the reduction is to use this knowledge! ” Almost all spotlights were based on the needs to suddenly get a hundred or two hundred thousand from somewhere. Then, it seemed to him, everything would have settled properly, and the farm would go, and the holes would be bent, and the income can be accounted for, and you can bring yourself to the opportunity to pay all debts. And he ended his speech: - But what do you order to do? No, and there is no such benefactor who would decide to give two hundred or at least one hundred thousand bent! Apparently, God does not want.

“Still,” Chichikov thought, “God two hundred thousand has sent a kind of fool!”

“I have, perhaps, a three millionth aunt,” said Khlobuev, “the old woman is praying: it gives to churches and monasteries, but to help my neighbor Tugenka.” And the old woman is very wonderful. The old -time, the aunt, which would be worth a look at. She has hundreds of four canaries. Pugs, and the dwelling, and the servants, which are now not. The smaller of the servants will be sixty years old, even though she calls him: “Hey, small!” If the guest somehow behaves like that, then she will order a dinner to put it on a dish. And they will surpass, right.

Platonov grinned.

- And what is her last name and where does she live? - asked Chichikov.

- She lives in our city - Alexandra Ivanovna Hanasarova.

“Why can't you turn to her?” - said with the fate of Platonov. - It seems to me that if she only became closer to the position of your family, she would not be able to refuse you, no matter how tuga.

- Well, no, in power! The aunt's nature is stronger. This is an old woman - flint, Plato Mikhalych! Yes, at that, there are saints without me who are falling around near her. There is one who marks into the governors, sank into her relatives ... God with him! Maybe he will have time! God with them with everyone! I did not know how to drive up before, and now even more so: the back is not bending.

"Fool! - thought Chichikov. - Yes, I would take care of a kind of aunt as a nanny for a child! ”

“Well, it’s so much to talk,” said Chlobuev. - Hey, Kiryushka! Bring another bottle of champagne.

“No, no, I will not drink anymore,” said Platonov.

“I also,” said Chichikov. And both they refused decisively.

- Well, at least, let me visit me in my city: on the eight of June I give lunch to our city dignitaries.

- Have mercy! - exclaimed Platonov. - In this state, having ruined completely, - and another lunch?

- What to do? it is forbidden. This is a duty, ”said Chlobuev. - They also treated me.

"What to do with him?" - thought Platonov. He did not yet know that in Rus', in Moscow and other cities, there were such sages whom life is an inexplicable mystery. Everything seems to have lived, around in debt, from nowhere, no means, and lunch, which is set, seems to be the last; And the diners think that tomorrow the owner will be dragged to prison. It takes ten years after that - the sage is still holding in the world, even more than the same circle in debt and also sets dinner, and everyone thinks that he is the last, and everyone is sure that tomorrow they will drag the owner into prison. The same sage was Khlobuev. Only one Rus' could exist in this way. Having nothing, he treated and gravity, and even provided patronage, encouraged all sorts of artists who came to the city, gave them shelter and apartment. If <would <u> who looked into his house, who was in the city, he would not have found out who the master was in him. Today, Pop in Riza served there a prayer service there, tomorrow the French actors gave a rehearsal. On another day, some kind of almost known to anyone in the house, settled in the living room itself with papers and started an office there, and this did not bother, did not bother anyone in the house, as if there was everyday business. Sometimes for days there were no crumbs in the house, sometimes they set in it such a lunch that would satisfy the taste of a sophisticated gastronom. The owner was a festive, cheerful, with a posture of a rich master, with a gait of a man whom life proceeds in abundance and contentment. But at times there were such heavy minutes that the other would have been hanging or shooting himself in his place for a long time. But he was saved by a religious mood, which in a strange way was combined in him with his dissenting life. In these bitter, heavy minutes, he unfolded the book and read the lives of sufferers and workers who brought up his spirit to be above suffering and misfortunes. His soul at that time all softened, his spirit was touched and his eyes were performed with tears. And - a strange thing! -Almost always, at that time, unexpected help came to him at that time. Or one of the old friends remembered him and sent him money; or some kind of passing a stranger, accidentally hearing a story about him, with the rapid greatness of the female heart sent him a rich presentation; Or won somewhere in favor of his business, which he never heard of. Hoiffedly, gratefully, he then recognized the immense merciful of the seizure, served a thanksgiving prayer and - again began his dissolved life.

- He mowing me, right, miserable! - said Chichikov Platonov when they, saying goodbye to him, left him.

- Prodigal son! - said Chichikov. - There is nothing to regret about such people.

And soon they both stopped thinking about him: Platonov - because he looked lazily and half asleep at the positions of people, as well as for everything in the world. His heart was compassionate and puppy at the sight of the suffering of others, but impressions somehow did not impress deeply in his soul. Therefore, he did not think about Chlobuev, that he did not think about himself. Chichikov did not think about Chlobuev that all thoughts were busy with the purchased purchase. He calculated, calculated and figured out all the benefits of the purchased estate. And no matter how much he considered, no matter what side he was wrapped in, I saw that in any case the purchase was beneficial. It was possible to do so as to lay the estate in a pawnshop. It was possible to do so as to lay only dead and fugitives. It was also possible to do so that previously all the best lands are sprinkled in parts, and then lay in a pawnshop. It was also possible to dispose of in such a way as to engage in the economy itself and become a landowner, according to Kostanzhogla, using his advice as a neighbor and a benefactor. It was even possible to act in such a way as to resell the estate (of course, if you don’t want to host yourself), leaving the runaway and the dead. Then another benefit was presented: it was possible to escape from these places and not to pay Kostanzhogle money borrowed from him. In a word, in every possible way, no matter how he wrapped this matter, I saw that in any case the purchase was beneficial. He felt pleasure - the pleasure of that he was now the landowner, the landowner is not fantastic, but real, landowner, who already has lands, and lands, and people are not dreamy, not in the imagination, but existing. And he gradually began to bounce, and rub his hands, and sing his hands, and crumble, and trimmed it on his fist, putting him on his mouth, as if on a pipe, some march, and even said aloud a few encouraging words and names to himself , like a muzzle and a captlunchik. But then, remembering that he was not alone, he suddenly became quiet, he tried to somehow hush up an immoderate impulse of delights, and when Platonov, having accepted some of these sounds for a speech turned to him, asked him: “What?” - He answered: "Nothing."

Then, looking around him, he noticed that they were driving a beautiful grove; The pretty birch fence stretched from the right and left. A white stone church flickered between the trees. At the end of the street, a gentleman appeared, who was walking towards them, in a cap, with a cloth stick in his hand. The licked Aglitsky dog ​​on high legs fled in front of him.

- Wait! - said Platonov to Kucher and jumped out of the stroller.

Chichikov also came out of him from the stroller. They walked towards the master. Yarb had already managed to go stabbed with the Aglitsky dog, with whom, apparently, he was familiar for a long time, because he took indifferently in his thick muzzle a living publishing of Azor (the so -called Aglitsky dog). The nimble dog, in the name of Azor, leaning the yoke, ran to Platonov, licked his hands with a agile tongue, jumped on Chichikov’s chest with intention of lick his lips, but did not reach him and, pushed away by him, ran back to Platonov, trying to lick him even in his ear.

Plato and the gentleman, walking towards, at that time came together and hugged.

- Have mercy, brother Plato! What are you doing with me? - the master asked vividly.

- Like what? - Platonov answered indifferently.

- But how really: three days from you neither a rumor nor spirit! The groom from the rooster brought your stallion. "I went, he says, with some barin." Well, if only the word said: Kuda, why, how long? Have mercy, brother, how can you do this? And I God knows what I have not changed his mind these days!

- Well, what to do? I forgot, ”said Platonov. - We drove to Konstantin Fedorovich ... He bows to you, sister as well. I recommend you Pavel Ivanovich Chichikov. Pavel Ivanovich, - Brother Vasily. I ask you to love him in the same way as me.

Brother Vasily and Chichikov, having removed the cartules, kissed.

“Who would be this Chichikov? - thought Brother Vasily. “Brother Plato is illegible for dating and, rightly, did not find out what kind of person he was.” And he looked around Chichikov, as far as decency allowed, and saw that he was standing, leaning his head somewhat and retaining a pleasant expression in his face.

For his part, Chichikov also looked around how much decency allowed, Brother Vasily. He was the growth of the lower Plato, his hair was dark and his face is far from so beautiful; But in the features of his face there was a lot of life and animation. It was evident that he was not in a nap and hibernation.

- Do you know, Vasily, what I came up with? - said brother Plato.

- What? - asked Vasily.

-To go through Holy Rus', that's exactly with Pavel Ivanovich: maybe this will blur and grind my sploas.

“How did he suddenly decide? ..” Vasily began to say, puzzled in earnest in such a decision, and almost added: “And he also planned to go with a man whom you see for the first time, who, perhaps, rubbish, And the devil knows what! " And, full of distrust, he began to consider Chichikov’s squint and saw that he was holding out of unusually decent, preserving all the same pleasant mood of his head a little to one side and respectful expression in his face, so it was impossible to find out what kind of Chichikov was.

In silence, they went all three along the road, on the left hand of which was the white stone church flickering between the trees, on the right - began to show, also between the trees, the construction of the Lord's court. Finally, the gates appeared. They entered the courtyard, where there was an old master's house under a high roof. Two huge linden, growing in the middle of the courtyard, covered almost half of his shadow. Through their beloved branches lowered down, the walls of the house, located behind them, barely ate their branches. There were several long benches under the linden. Brother Vasily invited Chichikov to sit down. Chichikov sat down, and Platonov sat down. Throughout the yard, the fragrance of flowering sirens and cherries spilled, which, hung from everywhere from the garden to the courtyard through a pretty birch fence, circled it around, seemed a flowering chain or a bead necklace that crowned it.

The seized and clever children of about seventeen, in a beautiful shirt of pink xandraits, brought and put in front of them the counters with water and multi -colored kvasses of all varieties hissed, like gas lemonades. Putting the countesses before them, he went to the tree and, taking a stand -legged striking against him, went to the garden. At the Platonov brothers, the whole yard worked in the garden, all the servants were gardeners, or better to say, there were no servants, but the gardeners sometimes corrected this position. Brother Vasily claimed that you can do without servants. Anyone can give something, and for this you should not start a special class; It is as if a Russian person is only good, and it’s good, and beautiful, and cheeky, and works a lot, as long as he walks in a shirt and zipun, but what, as soon as he climbs into a German certificate, will become clumsy and unskilled, and sluggish , and lazy. He argued that his cleanliness is contained by the case, as long as he still wears a shirt and zipun, and that as soon as he climbs into a German certificate, he does not change his shirts, and does not go to the bathhouse, and sleeps in a certificate, and will start with a certificate He under the certificate and bugs, and fleas, and the devil knows what. In this, maybe he was right. In the village, their people were dressed somehow especially doughly and neatly, and such beautiful shirts and zipunes had to be found far.

- Do you want to cool down? - said brother Vasily Chichikov, pointing to the countesses. - This is the kvass of our factory; They have long been famous for our house.

Chichikov poured a glass from the first decanter - like a lipets, which he once saw in Poland: the game is like champagne, and the gas healed with a pleasant grip from his mouth.

- Nectar! - said Chichikov. I drank a glass from another decanter - even better.

- In which direction and in what places do you intend to mainly go? - Brother Vasily asked.

“I’m going,” Chichikov said, rubbing his knee with his hand, accompanying the lightweight torso and tilting his head to one side, “not so much in need, but for the need of another.” General Betrishchev, a close friend and, one might say, a philanthropist, asked to visit relatives. Relatives, of course, are relatives, but partly, so to speak, for oneself, for not to mention the benefits of hemorrhoidal terms - to see the light and fluttrack of people - there is already in itself, so to speak, a living book and the second science .

Brother Vasily thought. “This man says somewhat ornate, but in his words there is true,” he thought <he>. “My brother Plato lacks the knowledge of people, light and life.” After a somewhat pause, he said so out loud:

“I'm starting to think, Plato, that the trip can, for sure, stir up you.” You have a mental hibernation. You just fell asleep, and did not fall asleep from satiety or fatigue, but from a lack of living impressions and sensations. Here I am completely opposite. I would really want to feel so vividly and not so close to take everything that happens to my heart.

- Freely take everything close to heart! - said Plato. “You seek anxiety for yourself and compose anxieties for yourself.”

- How to compose, when already at every step, trouble? - said Vasily. - You heard what kind of Lenitsyn’s thing played with us? He captured the wasteland, where we celebrate a red hill.

“He doesn’t know, that's why he captured,” said Plato, “a new man, he just came from St. Petersburg.” He needs to explain, explain.

- He knows, he knows very much. I sent him to tell him, but he answered with rudeness.

“You had to go to explain yourself.” Talk with him yourself.

- Oh no. He was already overwhelming too much. I will not go to him. Go if you want, you.

“I would go, but I'm not interfering.” He can lead me and deceive me.

“Yes, if you like, I will go,” Chichikov said.

Vasily glanced at him and thought: "An eka hunter to ride!"

“You give me only the concept of what kind of person he is,” said Chichikov, “and what's the matter.”

- It is ashamed to impose such an unpleasant commission on you, because one expression with such a person is already an unpleasant commission for me. It must be told that he was from the simple, small nobles of our province, he was injected in St. Petersburg, went out to people somehow, married there for someone's side daughter, and he was overwhelmed. It sets tones here. Yes, in our province, thank God, the people live not stupid: fashion is not a decree for us, and Petersburg is not a church.

“Of course,” said Chichikov, “but what is it?”

-And the matter is really nonsense. He does not have enough land - well, he captured someone else's wasteland, that is, he hoped that it was not needed, and the owners <forgotten> about it, and we, as it were on purpose, have been going to celebrate a red hill there for a century, for centuries. For this occasion, I am ready to sacrifice better other lands than to give it. The custom is a shrine for me.

“So you are ready to give him other lands?”

- That is, if he had not done with me; But he wants, as I see, to fall in the court. Perhaps we will see who will win. Although on the plan is not so clear, there are witnesses - the old people are still alive and remember.

“Um! - thought Chichikov. “Both, as I see, with a shower.” And he said out loud:

- And it seems to me that this case can be deprived of the Mitten. It all depends on the intermediary. Writing ... [98]

. . . . . .

... that for you it will be very profitable to translate, for example, in my name of all dead souls, which, according to the tales of the last revision, are listed in your estates, so that I pay taxes for them. And in order not to submit what temptation, you will make this transfer through the merchant of the fortress, as if these souls were alive.

“Here you have! - thought Lenitsyn. “This is something elderly.” And somewhat even moved back with a chair, because he was completely puzzled.

“I have no doubt in any way that you will completely agree to this matter,” said Chichikov, “because this is a completely kind, as we said now.” It will be committed between solid people secretly, and the temptation to anyone.

What to do here? Lenitsyn found himself in a difficult situation. He could not foresee the opinion that he had shortly expressed led him to such a quick implementation in practice. The proposal was extremely unexpected. Of course, nothing harmful could be in this act for anyone: the landowners would still laid these souls along with the living, therefore, there can be no loss; The difference is that they would be in the same hands, and then they would be in different ones. Nevertheless, he found it difficult. He was a legislator and a businessman, and a deed in a good way: he would not have decided to do any bribery. But then he stopped, not knowing what name to give this action - whether it was right or wrong. If someone else turned to him with such a proposal, he could say: “This is nonsense! trifles! I don't want to play dolls or fool around. ” But he already liked the guest so, so they agreed in many ways about the successes of enlightenment and sciences - how to refuse? Lenitsyn was in a transient position.

But at that time, as if, then, then, to help grief, a young cubular mistress, the wife of Lenitsyn, and pale, and thin, and dressed with taste entered the room, like all Petersburg ladies. Behind her was carried out by his mother in her arms, a first-a-old child, the fruit of the delicate love of recently married spouses. Chichikov, of course, approached the same hour to the lady and, not to mention a decent greeting, with one pleasant tilt of the head to the side placed her a lot in his favor. Then he ran to the child. He was bursting out; But, however, Chichikov succeeded in the words: "Agu, Au, Darling!" - Pulling off the fingers and a carcass printing from the clock lure him in his arms to you. Having taken him to his arms, he began to raise him up and thus excited a pleasant grin in the child, which greatly delighted both parents.

But from pleasure or from something else, the child suddenly behaved badly. Lenitsyna's wife screamed:

- Oh my god! He ruined the whole tailcoat!

Chichikov looked: the sleeve of the new tailcoat was ruined. "Shooting you would have been picked up, damned devil!" He muttered in his hearts to himself.

The owner, both the mistress and mother - all ran after the cologne; From all sides they began to wipe it.

“Nothing, nothing, absolutely nothing,” said Chichikov. -Can something innocent child? - And at the same time he thought to himself: “Why, how accurately I wrapped it up, the cranks are damned!” - Golden age! He said, when he was completely wiped and a pleasant expression returned to his face.

“But for sure,” said the owner, turning to Chichikov, also with a pleasant smile, “what could be more enviable than childhood: no worries, no thoughts about the future ...

“A state that you can change for this hour,” Chichikov said.

“For the eyes,” said Lenitsyn.

But, it seems, both lied: offer them such an exchange, they would immediately backward yard. And what a joy to sit at the mother in her arms and spoil the tailcoat!

The young mistress and firstborn left with their mother, because he needed to correct something: having awarded Chichikov, he did not forget himself.

This, apparently, the insignificant circumstance completely knocked the owner to satisfy Chichikov. How, in fact, to refuse such a guest who had so much caressed his little one and generously paid for that his own tailcoat? Lenitsyn thought like this: “Why, in fact, not to fulfill his requests, if such is his desire?” [99] ....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

<One of the last chapters> [100]

At the same time, when Chichikov in the Persian new robe of golden thermalama, collapsing on the couch, was traded with a visiting a smuggler of Jewish origin and a German reprimand, and they were already lying in front of the first Dutch canvas and two paper boxes with great soap. the first -time properties (it was soap exactly that he once acquired at the Radziwill Customs; it really had the property of informing the tenderness and whiteness of the cheeks amazing) - at a time when he, as an expert, bought these products necessary for a well -mannered person, there was a thunder rang out An approaching carriage, responding with a light trembling of indoor windows and walls, and his Excellency Alexei Ivanovich Lenitsyn entered.

- I imagine to the court of excellency: what is the canvas, and what is soap, and what is this day yesterday! - At the same time, Chichikov put on his head an Ermolka, embroidered with gold and beads, and found himself like a Persian shah, full of dignity and greatness.

But his Excellency, without answering the question, said with a preoccupied look:

- I need to talk to you about the case.

In his face, a disorder was noticeable. The venerable merchant of the German reprimand was expelled for the same hour, and they remained <alone>.

- Do you know what kind of trouble? Another testament of the old woman, made back, was found five <years>. Half of the name is given to the monastery, and the other - both pupils in half, and nothing else.

Chichikov dumbfounded.

- Well, this is a testament - nonsense. It means nothing, it is destroyed by the second.

“But this is not said in the last testament that the first is destroyed by them.”

- This is, of course: the latter destroys the first. The first testament is no good. I know the will of the deceased well. I was with her. Who signed it? Who were witnesses?

- It is attested, as it should, in court. The witness was the former conscientious judge Burmilov and Khavanov.

“Fucking,” thought Chichikov, “Khavanov, they say, is honest; Burmilov is an old Hange, reads on the holidays of the Apostle in Churches.

“But nonsense, nonsense,” he said aloud and immediately felt determination for everything. - I know this better: I participated at the last minutes of the deceased. I know this best. I am ready to swear allegiance.

These words and determination for a minute reassured Lenitsyn. He was very excited and was already beginning to suspect whether there was any fabrication from Chichikov regarding the will. Now he reproached himself with suspicion. The willingness to swear was obvious proof that Chichikov is <fider ”. We do not know whether Pavel Ivanovich would definitely take the spirit of Pavel on the saint, but it was enough to say the spirit.

- Be quiet, I will talk about this case with some legal advisers. There should be nothing on your part here; You must be completely aside. I can now live in the city, as much as I like.

Chichikov ordered the same hour to submit the crew and went to the legal adviser. This legal adviser was extraordinary experience. For fifteen years, he was in court, and so he knew how to dispose that it was impossible to refuse from his post. Everyone knew him, for his exploits should have been sent six times to the settlement. Around and from all sides he was in suspicions, but no one could build obvious and proven evidence. There was really something mysterious, and he could be safely recognized as a sorcerer if the story described by us belonged to the times of ignorance.

The legal adviser struck the coldness of his appearance, the oily of his dressing gown, representing the good furniture of the red tree perfect, the gold watch under a glass cap, a chandelier that converted through a quilted cover, which retained it, and generally everything that was around and had a bright seal of a brilliant European education .

Without stopping, however, the skeptical appearance of the legal adviser, Chichikov explained the difficult points of the case and, in the tempting perspective, depicted subsequent gratitude for the good advice and participation.

The legal adviser responded to this with an depiction of the infidelity of everything earthly and also skillfully notice that the crane in the sky means nothing, but the tit in the hand was needed.

There is nothing to do: it was necessary to give the tit in the hands. The skeptical coldness of the philosopher suddenly disappeared. It turned out that this was the most -dumber person, the most compassive and the most comprehensive in conversations, not inferior to the dexterity of the revolutions of Chichikov himself.

-Let you instead of starting a long business, you, rightly, did not consider the testament very well: there, right, there is some kind of suppose. You take it to your time for a while. Although, of course, it is forbidden to take such things at home, but if I ask some officials well ... I will use my participation for my part.

I understand, Chichikov thought and said:

“In fact, I, for sure, well, I don’t remember whether there is an or not or not,” as if he had not written this testament himself.

- Best of all, you look at it. However, in any case, ”he continued very good -naturedly,“ be always dead and do not be embarrassed by anything, even if it were worse than what happened. ” Never despair in anything: there is no incorrigible. Look at me: I am always obeyed. Whatever the incidents are elevated to me, my calmness is unshakable.

The face of the legal adviser-philosopher was really in extraordinary calm, so there are a lot of Chichikov ... [101]

“Of course, this is the first thing,” said <he>. “But you must admit, however, that there may be such cases and deeds, such things and such bite on the part of enemies, and such difficult provisions that all calm will fly away.”

“Believe me, this is cowardly,” answered very fraudulently and good-natured philosopher-Jourist. - Try only that the production of the case is based on papers, so that there is nothing in words. And as soon as you see that the matter is going to the denouement and is convenient to decide, try to justify and protect yourself - no, just confuse with new introductory and so extraneous articles.

- That is, so that ...

“To confuse, confuse,“ and nothing more, ”answered the philosopher,“ to introduce outsiders into this business, other circumstances that are confused here and others, to make it difficult - and nothing more. ” And there let the visiting St. Petersburg official disassemble. Let him disassemble, let him disassemble it! He repeated, looking with extraordinary pleasure in Chichikov’s eyes, as the teacher looks at the student when he explains to him a tempting place from Russian grammar.

“Yes, it is good if you pick up such circumstances that are able to put the MGLU in the eyes,” Chichikov said, looking with pleasure into the eyes of the philosopher, as a student who understood the tempting place explained by the teacher.

- Circumstances will be selected, they will pick up! Believe me: from frequent exercises and head will become resourceful. First of all, remember what will help you. In the complexity of the matter, many win for many: both officials need more, and they have more salary ... in a word, draw more faces into the matter. There is no need that others will fall in vain: but they can justify it easily, they need to respond to paper, they need to buy about <t> ... That's already bread ... Believe me, that as soon as the circumstances are critical, the first thing to confuse. So you can confuse, so confuse everything that no one will understand anything. Why am I calm? Because I know: let only my things go worse, yes, I will include everyone in my own-the governor, and the vice-governor, and the police officer, and the treasurer, I will confuse everyone. I know all their circumstances: who is angry with whom, and who is sulking on whom, and who wants to get to whom. There, perhaps, let them get out, while they get out, others will have time to cash in. After all, only crayfish are caught in muddy water. Everyone is just waiting to confuse. -Here, the philosopher lawyer looked in the eyes again with the pleasure with which the teacher explains the student of the still tempting place from Russian grammar.

“No, this man, for sure, is a sage,” Chichikov thought to himself and parted with the legal adviser in the most understanding and in the best mood.

Having completely calmed down and strengthened, he rushed to elastic pillows of strollers with careless dexterity, ordered Selifana to throw his body back (he rode the lifted body and even buttoned skin) and settled down, exactly like a retired hussar colonel or cherry and cherry and cherry-blessings. Turning one leg under another, turning with pleasantness to the oncoming face, shining from under the silk new hat, pushed somewhat in the ear. Selifan was ordered to hold a direction towards the living room. Merchants, and visitors and native, standing at the door of the shops, respectfully removed their hats, and Chichikov, not without dignity, lifted their response to them. Many of them were already familiar to him; Others were at least visitors, but, fascinated by a clever look of the master, greeted him as acquaintances. The fair in the city of T -Fundes did not stop. Horse and agricultural, began - with red goods for the gentlemen of the Enlightenment of the Higher. The merchants who arrived on wheels had to return back to return, like on a sleigh.

-Please, please, sir! - spoke at the cloth shop, courteously drawing, with an open head, the German frock coat of Moscow sewing, with a hat in his hand on the departure, only holding a shaved round chin and the expression of the subtleties of enlightenment in his face only with two fingers.

Chichikov entered the shop.

-Show me, my dear, cloth.

A favorable merchant immediately lifted up the boarding board from the table and, thus making a passage, found himself in a shop, with his back to the goods and facing the buyer.

He became his back to the goods and facing the buyer, the merchant, with a bare head and hat on the departure, once again greeted Chichikov. Then he put on his hat and, pleasantly bending, with both hands rested on the table, said this:

-What kind of cloth-sir? Do you prefer English manufactories or domestic fabrication?

“Domestic factory,” said Chichikov, “but only the best variety called Aglitsky.”

- What colors do you want to have? - asked the merchant, all so <The same pleasantly hesitating on two hands rested on the table.

“Flowers of dark, olive or bottle with spark, approaching, so to speak, to the lingonberry,” Chichikov said.

“I can say that you will receive the first variety, which is better than <no> in both capitals,” said the merchant, dragging him to get a thing on top; He left her deftly on the table, turned it from the other end and brought it to the light. -What a tide! The most fashionable, last taste!

The cloth shone like silk. The merchant sniffed with an instinct that he was standing in front of him, and did not want to start with a ten -ruble one.

“Decent,” said Chichikov, stroking slightly. “But you know, the most honorable?” Show me right away what you finally show, and the color is more ... more out of it, so that there are sparks.

-I understand, sir: you really want the color that it is in Pek in the fashion> enters. I have a supervisory cloth. I will warn that the high price, but also of high dignity.

- Let's.

About the price not a word.

The thing fell on top. The merchant unfolded her with great art, caught the other end and turned out exactly the silk matter, brought it to Chichikov so that <that> had the opportunity not only to consider it, but even sniff, saying only: only:

-Just with cloth! The color of Navarinsky smoke with a flame.

The price agreed. Iron arshin, like the wand of the sorcerer, grabbed Chichikov immediately on the tailcoat <and> on the pantalons. Having made a cut with scissors, the merchant produced with both hands clever drum drum in its entire width, at the end of which he bowed to Chichikov with the smallesting pleasantness. Cloth was immediately curled up and cleverly fascinated in paper; The bundle spun under a light twine. Chichikov wanted to climb into his pocket, but he felt, <what> his lower back was pleasantly surrounded by someone’s very delicate hand, and his ears heard:

- What are you buying here, respectable?

- Ah, a nicious unexpected meeting! - said Chichikov.

“A pleasant collision,” said the voice of the same one who surrounded his lower back. It was Vishnnopokromov. - I was preparing to go through the shop without attention, suddenly I see a familiar face - how to abandon the pleasant pleasure! There is nothing to say, cloth this year is incomparably better. After all, this is shame, shame! I could not find in any way ... I am ready thirty rubles, forty rubles ... Take fifty even, but give me a good one. For me, or to have a thing that, for sure, was already excellent, or it is better not to have at all. Is not it?

- Absolutely! - said Chichikov. “Why work, if not, to have a good thing for sure?”

“Show me a cloth of average prices,” came behind a voice that seemed to Chichikov to friends. He turned around: it was Khlobuev. It was clear that he bought a cloth not for a whim, because the Serpent was painfully rubbed.

- Ah, Pavel Ivanovich! Let me finally talk to you. You will not meet you anywhere. I have been several times - all of you is not and not.

-The most venerable, I was so busy that, her, there, there is no time. - He looked around, as if from explanation to slip away, and saw Murazov, which is entering the shop. - Afanasy Vasilievich! Oh my god! - said Chichikov. - Here is a pleasant collision!

And after him he repeated Vishnopokromov:

- Afanasy Vasilievich!

<lobuev> repeated:

- Afanasy Vasilievich!

And, finally, a well -reserved merchant, taking the hat from the head as much as the hand could, and leaning forward, said:

- Athanasia Vasilievich is our lowest respect!

On their faces, the dog’s helpfulness that the dog’s offset of people provides millionaires.

The old man bowed to everyone and turned directly to Chlobuev:

- Excuse me: I, seeing from afar, how you entered the shop, decided to bother you. If you will be freely and on the way past my house, so do mercy, go a little time. I will need to talk with you.

Chlobuev said:

- Very good, Afanasy Vasilievich.

“What a wonderful weather we have, Afanasy Vasilievich,” Chichikov said.

“Is it not true, Afanasy Vasilievich,” Vishnnopokromov picked up, “because this is unusual.”

-Yes, thanks to God, it is not bad. But you would need a rain for sowing.

“Very, very much,” said Vishnepokromov, “even for hunting is good.”

“Yes, the rain would not have interfered very much,” said Chichikov, who did not need a rain, but how nice it is to agree with who has a million.

And the old man, bowing again with everyone, came out.

“My head is just spinning,” said Chichikov, “how can you think that this person has ten million.” It’s just incredible.

“Important, however, the thing,” said Vishnipokromov, “the capital should not be in the same <hands>.” This is now the subject of treatises throughout Europe. You have money, - well, inform others: treat, give balls, perform a beneficial luxury that gives bread to masters, artisans.

“I can’t understand that,” Chichikov said. - Ten million - and lives like a simple man! After all, with ten milions, the devil knows what can be done. After all, this can be made in such a way that you will not have another society, like generals and princes.

“Yes-s,” the merchant added, “Athanasius Vasilievich has a lot of impenetration with all the venerable qualities.” If the merchant is respectable, so he is not a merchant, he is already a Nepezant in some way. Then I have to take both the bed in the theater, and my daughter is already for a simple colonel-no, sir, I won’t give out: I am for the general, otherwise I will not give her out. What do I need a colonel? I have to supply the pastry for lunch, and not like a cook ...

- What to say! Have mercy, ”said Vishnopokromov,“ with ten millions, what not to do? ” Give me ten million - you look at what I will do!

“No,” Chichikov thought, “you will not have much use with ten million.” But if I would have ten million, I would have done something. ”

“No, if now, after these terrible experiments, ten million! - thought Chlobuev. “Uh, now I’m not like that: you will learn the price of any penny with experience.” And then, thinking for a minute, he asked himself internally: "Would he have ordered exactly smarter now?" And, waving his hand, he added: “Huck! I think I would have just as soon as before, ”and left the shop, burning with the desire to know that Murazov would declare him.

- I'm waiting for you, Peter Petrovich! - said Murazov, seeing the incoming Chlobuev. - Please to my room.

And he led Khlobuev into a room already familiar to the reader, more unpretentious than which could not be found from an official who received seven hundred rubles a year of salary.

- Tell me, now, now, I believe, your circumstances are better? After the aunt did you get something?

- How can I tell you, Afanasy Vasilievich? I don't know if my circumstances are better. I got only a naughty of peasants and thirty thousand money, which I had to pay with part of my debts - and I have nothing again. And the main thing is that the case is the most unclean on this testament. Here, Afanasy Vasilievich, such fraud have started! I’ll tell you now, and you marvel at what this is being done. This Chichikov ...

- Let me, Peter Petrovich: Before talking about this to Chichikov, let me talk about you. Tell me: how much, in your opinion, would it be satisfactory for you and then enough to completely get out of circumstances?

“My circumstances are difficult,” said Chlobuev. - Yes, in order to get out of circumstances, to pay completely and be in the ability to live in the most moderate way, I need at least one hundred thousand, if not more. In a word, this is impossible for me.

“Well, if you had it, how would you then lead your life?”

- Well, then I would have hired an apartment for myself, I would have taken up the upbringing of children, because I couldn’t serve me myself: I'm not good.

- Why are you not good?

- Yes, wog me, judge for yourself! I can’t start with a clerical scribe. You have forgotten that I have a family. I am forty, my lower back hurts, I was laveled; And the positions will not give me more important; I'm not in good account. I confess to you: I would not take a profitable position myself. I am a person, though crazy, and a gambler, and I will not take everything that you want, but I won’t take bribs. I can’t get along with Krasninosov and Samosvistov.

-But all, sorry, sir, I cannot understand how to be without a road; how to go on the road; how to go when there is no land underfoot; How to swim when Chelny is not on the water? But life is a journey. Sorry, Peter Petrovich, those gentlemen, after all, about whom you are talking about, they are on some road, they still work. Well, let's put it somehow struck, as it happens with all sinful; Yes, there is a hope that they will hit again. Who goes is impossible, so that he does not come; There is a hope that it will come across. But how to get on some road, who remains idly? After all, the road will not come to me.

- Believe me, Afanasy Vasilievich, I feel completely justice <so>, but I tell you that all activities died in me resolutely; I do not see that I can make any benefit to someone in the world. I feel that I am a resolutely useless log. Before, while it was younger, it seemed to me that the whole thing was in money, that if I had hundreds of thousands in my hands, I would make a lot of people: I would help poor artists, we would have started libraries, useful institutions, and collect collections. I am a person not without taste and, I know, in many ways I could much better dispose of those of our rich people who do all this stupidly. And now I see that this is a vanity, and this is a little sense. No, Afanasy Vasilievich, I’m not going anywhere, nowhere, I say to you. It is not capable of the slightest business.

- Listen, Peter <Petrovich>! But after all, you pray, go to church, do not miss, I know, neither utryns nor Vespers. Although you do not want to get up early, but you get up and go - go at four in the morning, when no one rises.

- This is another matter, Afanasy Vasilievich. I do this to save the soul, because in the conviction that I will smoke a idle life at least somewhat, that no matter how duren I am, but prayers still mean something from God. I’ll tell you that I pray-even without faith, but still pray. It is only heard that there is a gentleman, on whom everything depends, like a horse and cattle, which is plowing, knows the instinct of that, <who> harnesses.

- Therefore, you pray then to please the one whom you pray to save your soul, and this gives you strength and makes you rise early from bed. Believe me that if you have taken up your position in such a way, as if in confidence that you serve the one to whom you pray, you would have an activity, and none of the people could cool you.

- Afanasy Vasilievich! I will tell you again - this is another. In the first case, I see what I am doing. I tell you that I am ready to go to the monastery and the hardest that they will put on me, I will fulfill the labors and exploits there. I am sure that it is not my business to reason, which will be recovered <with those> who forced me to do; There I obey and I know that I obey God.

- Why don't you reason like that in the affairs of the world? Indeed, in the light, we must serve God, and not to anyone else. If we serve to another who we serve, we are only serving, being sure that God tells, but without that we would not have served. Well another, all the abilities and gifts that are all kinds of? After all, these are our prayers: then - in words, and this is a deed. After all, you can’t go to the monastery: you are attached to the world, you have a family.

Here Murazov was silent. Chlobuev also fell silent.

- So you believe that if, for example, <a> had two hundred thousand, so you could strengthen life and the novels from now on life is more calculating?

“That is, at least, I will do what can be done,” I will take care of the upbringing of children, I will have the opportunity to deliver good teachers to them.

- Do you tell you, Peter Petrovich, that after two years you will be around again in debt, like in laces?

Khlobuev was silent for somewhat and began with an arrangement:

- However, no, after such experiments ...

“Well, the experiments,” said Murazov. - After all, I know you. You are a person with a good soul: a friend will come to you to ask for a loan - you will give him; You will see a poor person - you will want to help; A pleasant guest will come to you - you want to get better to treat, and submit to the first good movement, and you will pay the calculation. And let me finally tell you from sincerity that you are not able to educate your children. Only the father, who himself fulfilled his duty, can educate his children. Yes, and your spouse ... She is a kind soul ... She is not at all so brought up to raise children. I even think - excuse me, Peter Petrovich - will the children even be with you?

Khlobuev thoughtful; He began to mentally examine himself from all sides and finally felt that Murazov was partly right.

- You know, Peter Petrovich? Give me this - children, deeds; Leave your family and children: I will save them. After all, your circumstances are such that you are in my hands; After all, the matter is to die of hunger. Here everything needs to be decided. Do you know Ivan Potapych?

- And I respect very much, even though he walks in Siberian.

- Ivan Potapych was a millionaire, granted his daughters for officials, lived like a king; And how to get out - what to do? - went to the clerks. It was not fun for him from a silver dish to go for a simple bowl: it seemed that his hands did not rise to anything. Now Ivan Potapych could have a skeleton from a silver dish, but he doesn’t want to. He would have gained it again, but he says: “No, Afanasy Ivanovich, [102] I now serve is not for myself and <not> for myself, but because God was so" judged ". I don’t want to do anything of my own free will. I listen to you, because I want to obey God, not people, and since God only speaks with the mouths of the best people. You are smarter than me, and therefore I am not answering, but you. " This is what Ivan Potapych says; And he, if you say the truth, several times smarter than me.

- Afanasy Vasilievich! Your power and I am ready over to be <admit>, your servant and what you want: I will surrender to you. But do not give work on above: I am not Potapych and tell you that I am not good for anything.

-Not me, Pyotr Petrovich, I will impose, sir <on>, and since you would like to serve, as you say, so that is a thorough thing. The church is being built in one place with a kind -sided birth of pious people. Money is non -collection. Put on a simple Siberian ... After all, you are now a simple person, a ruined nobleman and the same beggar: what is there to be repaired here? - Yes, with a book in your hands, on a simple cart and go to cities and villages. From the bishop, you will receive blessings and a laid book, and with God.

Pyotr Petrovich was amazed at this completely new position. Still, he, after all, the noble of an ancient family, go with a book in his hands to ask for a church, moreover, shake on a cart! Meanwhile, you can’t get out and dodge: a thorough thing.

- Did you think? - said Murazov. “You will serve two services here: one service to God, and the other to me.”

- What are you?

- But what. Since you will go to those places where I have not yet been, so you will find out, everyone is in place: how are peasants live there, where it is richer, where they are in need and in what state everything is. I’ll tell you that I love peasants because it may be that I myself are from men. But the fact is that there was a lot of abomination between them. The schismatics there and all sorts of tramps confuse them, they restore them against the authorities, against the authorities and orders, and if a person is oppressed, he is easily rebelled. Well, it’s like it is difficult to incite a person who, for sure, tolerates. Yes, the fact is that reprisal should not begin from below. It’s bad then when they go to the fists: there will be no sense here - only the thieves are working. You are a smart person, you will consider, find out where a person really suffers from others, and where from your own restless temper, and then you will tell me all this. Just in case, I will give you a small amount for the distribution of those who are already really endured innocently. On your part, it will also be useful to console them with a word and better interpret them that God tells me to endure meekly, and pray at this time when it is unhappy, and not rampant and straighten himself. In a word, tell them, without exciting anyone against anyone, but reconciling everyone. If you see in whom hatred against anyone, use all the effort.

- Afanasy Vasilievich! The case that you entrust me to, ”said Khlobuev,“ a holy cause; But you will remember to whom you entrust him. It can be entrusted to a person of almost a holy life, who would already "know" to others.

- Yes, I am not saying that you do all this, but if possible, what is possible. The thing is that you will still come with the cognitions of those places and will have the concept of which position that land is in. The official will never encounter his face, and the man will not be frank with him. And you, asking for the church, look at everyone - both to the tradesman and the merchant, and you will have the opportunity to ask everyone. I say, for you, for the reason that the governor general is especially now in need of such people; And you, past all kinds of stationery, will receive a place where your life will not be useless.

“I’ll try, I will put an old man, how much strength is enough,” said Khlobuev. And his voice was noticeable, his back straightened, and his head rose, like a person who shines hope. - I see that God awarded you with reason, and you know another better than us, myopic people.

“Now let me ask you,” said Murazov, “why is Chichikov and what kind of family is?”

- And <pro> Chichikov I will tell you things unheard of. He does such things ... Do you know, Afanasy Vasilievich, that the will is false? The present was found, where the entire estate belongs to the pupils.

- What are you saying? Yes, who made a false testament?

-The fact of the matter is that the premium business! They say that Chichikov and that the will was signed after death: they dressed up some kind of woman, a deceased, and she signed. In a word, the matter is seductive. They say that thousands of requests came from different sides. The grooms are now approaching Marye Erasmeevna; Two officials are fighting because of her. That's what kind of business, Afanasy Vasilievich!

- I have not heard anything about it, but the matter, for sure, not without sin. Pavel Ivanovich Chichikov, I admit, is a transcassurous to me, ”said Murazov.

- I also submitted a request from myself, then to remind you that there is a closest heir ...

“And let them be all to fight,” Khlobuev thought, leaving. - Afanasy Vasilievich is not stupid. He gave me this guarantee, rightly thinking. To fulfill it is all. ” He began to think about the road, at a time when Murazov was still repeating in himself: “The person Pavel Ivanovich Chichikov! After all, if with a sort of will and perseverance and a good deed! ”

Meanwhile, in fact, in the courts there were requests for a request. There were relatives that no one had heard of. Like birds flies to the dead, so everything flew into the mystery, remaining after the old woman. Democrats on Chichikov, for the vileness of the last testament, denunciations for the trinite and the first testament, evidence in the redness and in the hiding of the amounts. The evidence was at Chichikov in the purchase of dead souls, in the transportation of smuggling during its being even at customs. They dug everything, found out its former story. God the news where all this sniffed and knew. There were only evidence even in such matters, about which Chichikov thought, except for his and four walls, no one knew. So far, all this was still a judge and it did not reach his ears, although the right note by the legal adviser, which he soon received, gave him somewhat to understand that the porridge would be brewed. The note was a brief content: “I hasten to notify you that there will be fuss in the case: but remember that you should not worry in any way. The main thing is calm. We will make everything. " This note reassured him completely. “This person is, for sure, a genius,” Chichikov said.

To top it off, the tailor at this time brought <dress>. <Chichikov> received a desire to look strong at himself in the new tailcoat of the Navarinsky flame with smoke. He pulled his pants that grabbed him miraculously from all sides, so at least draw him. The thighs were so gloriously covered, caviar, too, clutched all the small ones, communicating with even greater elasticity. As he pulled behind him a buckle, his stomach became exactly the drum. He hit him here with a brush, adding: "After all, what a fool, but in general he makes a picture." The tailcoat seemed to be sewn even better than his pants: not wrinkles, he covered all the sides, arched on interception, showing his entire overlap. A little sting under the right mouse, but this was even better at the waist. The tailor, who stood in a full celebration, said only: "Be quiet, except for St. Petersburg, they will not sew it anywhere." The tailor himself was from St. Petersburg and put on the sign: "A foreigner from London and Paris." He did not like to joke and at once he wanted to plug the throat with all the other tailors at once, so that no one would appear with such cities, and let him write to himself from some Carlser or Copengar.

Chichikov generously paid with the tailor and, remaining alone, began to consider himself at his leisure in the mirror, like an artist with aesthetic feeling and con amore. [103] It turned out that everything was somehow even better than before: the cheeks are more interesting, the chin is more tempting, the white collars gave the tone of the cheek, the satin blue tie gave the tone to the collars; The newfangled folds of the shirt gave a tie tone, a rich velvet <vest> gave <tone> to a shirt, and the tailcoat of Navarinsky smoke with a flame, shining like silk, gave a tone to everything. Turned right - good! Turned left - even better! An excess of such as a chamberlain or such a master who soads in French that in front of him the Frenchman himself is nothing, who, even getting angry, does not shame himself obscenely Russian word, does not even know how to choose in Russian, but will be released French dialect. The delicacy is like that! He tried, the bow of the head is a little to the side, take the pose, as if addressed to the lady of the middle years and the last education: there was just a picture. Artist, take a brush and write! In pleasure, he immediately made a slight jump, like Antrash. Shuddered the chest of drawers and slapped a bottle of cologne to the ground; But this did not cause any insanity. He called, as it should, a stupid skill fool and thought: “To whom now to appear first of all? All the best ... "

Suddenly in the front - like some blinking boots with spurs and a gendarme in complete weapons, as if "as if> in his face was a whole army. "The same time is ordered to come to the Governor General!" Chichikov was stunned. In front of him stuck a monster with a mustache, a horse tail on his head, a bandage over his shoulder, through another bandage, a huge broadsword was hung to his side. It seemed to him that with a different side, both the gun hung and the devil knew what: the whole army in one! He began to object, scared rudely spoke: "This hour is ordered!" Through the door to the front, he saw that it was flickering and another scared, looked out the window - and the crew. What to do here? So, as it was, in a tailcoat of the Navarinsky flame with smoke, he had to sit down and, trembling with his whole body, went to the Governor General, and the gendarme with him.

In the front they did not even come to his senses. “Go! The prince is already waiting for you, ”said the officer on duty. In front of him, as in a fog, the front flashed with the couriers taking bags, then the hall through which he went, thinking only: “That's how he would grab, but without trial, without everything, right to Siberia!” His heart was beating with such power with which even the highest lover does not beat. Finally, the door disappeared before him: the office appeared, with briefcases, cabinets and books, and the prince is angry, like anger itself.

- Daucer, destroyer! - said Chichikov. - He will destroy my soul, cut like a wolf of the lamb!

- I spared you, I allowed you to stay in the city, while you should have in the prison; And you tarnished yourself with again, dishonest fraud, which a person has ever tarnished.

The prince's lips trembled with anger.

- What, your excellency, a dishonest act and fraud? - Chichikov asked, trembling with his whole body.

“A woman,” said the prince, approaching a little closer and looking directly into Chichikov’s eyes, “a woman who signed a testament according to your dictation is captured and will become a full -time bet with you.”

Chichikov became pale as a canvas.

- Your Excellency! I will say the whole truth of the matter. It's my fault; Exactly, to blame; But not so to blame. I was surrounded by enemies.

“Nobody can hide you, because you have aboops several times more than what the last liar can <invent”. ” You in your whole life, I think, have not done a heavenly work. Every penny you have mined is dishonest, there is a theft and a dishonest cause, for which the whip and Siberia! No, now full! From that moment you will be allotted to the prison and there, along with the last bastards and robbers, you must <wait> of the permission of your fate. And this is more gracious, because <you> are worse than them a few <times>: they are in an Armenian and a sheepskin coat, and you ...

He looked at the tails of the Navarinsky flame with smoke and, holding the lace, called.

“Your Excellency,” Chichikov cried out, “be peaceful!” You are the father of the family. Do not spare me - old woman!

- You're lying! - the prince cried angrily. - Also, then you begged me with children and a family that you never had, now - a mother!

“Your Excellency, I am a bastard and the last villain,” Chichikov said in a voice ... [104] “I really lied, I had neither children nor family; But, God is a witness, I always wanted to have a wife, to fulfill the duty of a person and a citizen, in order to really earn the respect of citizens and bosses ... But what a distant gathering of circumstances! With blood, your excellency, blood had to be extracted. At every step, temptation and temptation ... enemies, and destroyers, and kidnappers. The whole life was like a vihor violent or a ship among the waves by the will of the winds. I am a man, your excellency!

Tears suddenly poured streams from his eyes. He fell at the feet of the prince, as he was in a tailcoat of the Navarinsky flame with smoke, in a velvet vest with a satin tie, new pants and combed hair poured out a clean smell of cologne.

- Go away from me! Call to be taken, soldier! - said the prince ascended.

- Your Excellency! - shouted <Chichikov> and wrapped around the prince's boots with both hands.

The feeling of shudder ran through all the veins of the prince.

- Go away, I tell you! He said, intensifying his leg out of Chichikov’s arms.

- Your Excellency! I will not get away from the place, until I will get mercy! - said <Chichikov ", not letting the prince's boots and drove along with his foot, along the floor in a tailcoat of the Navarinsky flame and smoke.

- Go, tell you! - he spoke with the inexplicable sense of disgust that a person feels at the sight of the ugly insect, which is not to crush the spirit with his foot. He shook off so that Chichikov felt a blow to his nose, lips and rounded chin, but did not let out his boot and kept his leg in his arms with more power. Two Dyuzhikh gendarmes dragged him out and, taking him by the arms, led them through all the rooms. He was pale, killed, in the insensitive-passionate state in which there is a person who sees a black, inevitable death before him, this is a monster, contrary to our nature ...

In the very door to the stairs towards - Murazov. A ray of hope suddenly slipped. In an instant, with the power of unnatural, he broke out of the hands of both gendarmes and rushed at the feet of an amazed old man.

- Father, Pavel Ivanovich, what's wrong with you?

- Save! lead to the prison, to death ...

The gendarmes grabbed him and led him, did not even let him hear.

A dancing raw closet with the smell of boots and a one of the garrison soldiers, a unpainted table, two nasty stools, with an iron grate window, a decrepit stove, through the cracks of which there was smoke and did not give warmth - that’s the abode where our "hero" was placed, it was already there. Beginning to eat the sweetness of life and attract the attention of compatriots in a thin new tailcoat of the Navarinsky flame and smoke. They did not even allow him to dispose of taking the necessary things with him, taking the box where there was money. Papers, fortresses for dead "souls" - everything was now with the officials! He fell to the ground, and a carnivorous worm of sadness of a terrible, hopeless wrapped around his heart. With increasing speed, she began to sharpen this heart, not protected by anything. Another day is such a day of such sadness, and there would not be a <chichikov at all in the world. But even a kind of importing hand did not doze over Chichikov. An hour later, the doors of the prison dissolved: the old Murazov ascended.

If the terrified scorching thirst was poured into the stream of key water that had dried up the throat, then he would not have revived as the poor Chichikov perked up.

- My savior! - said Chichikov and, suddenly grabbing his hand, quickly kissed and pressed to his chest. - God will reward you for visiting the unfortunate!

He burst into tears.

The old man looked at him with a mournful gaze and said only:

- Ah, Pavel, Pavel Ivanovich! Pavel Ivanovich, what did you do?

- I am a scoundrel ... is to blame ... I stopped ... But judge, judge, how can you do this? I am a nobleman. Without trial, without investigation, to throw it in jail, take everything away from me: things, a box ... There is money, there is all the property, there is all my property, Afanasy Vasilyevich, - the property that he then acquired by blood ...

And, unable to hold the gusts of sadness that again approached the heart, he sobbed loudly in his voice, penetrating the thickness of the walls of the prison and dullly responding in the distance, tore off the satin tie and, grabbing his hand near the collar, broke the tails of the Navarine flame on himself with smoke.

- Pavel Ivanovich, anyway: with property and with everything that is in the world, you must say goodbye. You fell under the inexorable law, and not under the power of which person.

- He killed himself, I know - he did not know how to stop in time. But why is such a terrible <kara>, Afanasy Vasilievich? Am I a robber? Did anyone suffer from me? Did I make someone unhappy? Labor and then, bloody then mined a penny. Why did you get a penny? Then, in order to be satisfied with the rest of the days, to leave something to the children whom he intended to acquire for the good, for the service of the Fatherland. I screamed, I do not argue, screamed ... What to do? But he screamed, seeing that you would not take a straight road and that the oblique road is more straight. But I worked, I was sophisticated. And these bastards, who take thousands from the treasury on the courts, are robbed by poor people, tear off the last penny with who has nothing! .. Afanasy Vasilyevich! I was not fornication, I did not get drunk. Why, how many works, how much iron patience! Yes, I can say, I bought all sorts of pennies obtained with suffering, suffering! Let someone be fraught with what I am! After all, that my whole life is a fierce struggle, a ship among the waves. And lost, Afanasy Vasilievich, what was acquired by such a struggle ...

He did not finish and sobbed loudly from the unbearable pain of the heart, fell on a chair, and tore off the bar of a completely torn half -torn floor, and threw it away from himself, and, running both hands into his hair, about the fortitude of which he had previously tried, ruthlessly torn them, delighted him, delighted him The pain, which he wanted to drown out an ineffective heart of the heart.

- Ah, Pavel Ivanovich, Pavel Ivanovich! - said <Murazov>, looking mournfully at him and swinging <head>. “I still think about which of you would be a person, if the same, both by force and patience, would have been working for good work for the best <ener>!” If at least one of those people who love good, but they would use as much effort for him, as you have to get your penny! .. Yes, they would be able to sacrifice for goodness and self-esteem and ambition, not sparing yourself like You did not spare for the mining of your penny! ..

- Afanasy Vasilievich! - said Poor Chichikov and grabbed him with both hands by the hands. - Oh, if I managed to free myself, return my property! I swear to you, I would now take a completely different life! Save, benefactor, save!

- What can I do? I have to fight with the law. Suppose, if I even decided on this, but the prince is fair, he will never retreat.

- benefactor! You can do everything. It’s not the law that I am afraid of me, I will find funds before the law, but the fact that I am Nonov I am thrown into prison, that I will be lost here like a dog, and that my property, papers, casket ... save!

He hugged the old man’s legs, doused them with tears.

- Ah, Pavel Ivanovich, Pavel Ivanovich! - said the old man Murazov, swinging "head". - How this property blinded you! Because of him, you do not hear your poor soul!

- I'll think about the soul, but save!

- Pavel Ivanovich! - said the old man Murazov and stopped. “To save you not in my power,” you yourself see. But I will attach an old man, what I can to facilitate your fate and free. I don’t know if it will be able to do this, but I will try. If, more than aspirations, it will be possible, Pavel Ivanovich, I will ask you a reward for work: throw all these creeps on these acquisitions. I tell you by honor that if I had lost my property, and I have more than yours, I would not cry. Her, <The case> is not in this property that they can confiscate from me, but in the one that no one can steal and take away! You really lived in the world enough. You yourself call your life a ship among the waves. You already have something to live the rest of days. Set in a quiet corner, closer to the church and simple, kind people; Or, if the strong desire to leave the descendants, marry a poorly kind girl, accustomed to moderation and simple economy. Forget this noisy world and all its seductive whims; Let him forget you. There is no reassurance in it. You see: everything in it is an enemy, a tempter or a traitor.

Chichikov thought. Something strange, some unknown tootole, unknown feelings, inexplicable to him, came to him: as if he wanted to wake up in him, something depressed from childhood with a harsh, dead teaching, the absence of boring childhood, the deserted of his native home, Besshumne loneliness, poverty and poverty of initial impressions, the stern look of fate, which looked at him is boring, through some kind of cloudy winter blizzard.

- Only save, Afanasy Vasilievich! - he cried out, - I will lead another life, the following to your advice! Here is my word!

“Look, Pavel Ivanovich, do not recede from the word,” said Murazov, holding his hand.

“I would have back, maybe if it weren’t for such a terrible lesson,” the poor Chichikov said, sighing and added: “But the lesson is heavy; Heavy, heavy lesson, Afanasy Vasilievich!

- It's good that is heavy. Thank God for this, pray. I will go about you.

Having said this, the old man came out.

Chichikov no longer cried, he did not tear a tailcoat and hair on himself: he calmed down.

- No, full! - He said finally, - another, another life. It's time to really become decent. Oh, if I somehow only get out and leave at least with a little capital, I will settle far from ... and the merchants? ..-He thought: “Well? Why leave this business acquired so hard? .. I will no longer buy, but you need to lay it down. After all, the acquisition was worth the work! I will lay it, lay it in order to buy an estate for money. I will become a landowner, because here you can do a lot of good. ” And in his thoughts were awakened by those feelings that he mastered when he was <u> gobbogly, [105] and sweet, in the war of the evening, a smart conversation between the owner about how fruitful and useful it is to take the estate. The village so suddenly introduced himself perfectly, exactly how he could feel all the charms of the village.

- We are stupid, chasing the bustle! He said finally. - Right, from idleness! Everything is close, everything is at hand, and we run for the distant <lands>. What is not life if you take it even in the wilderness? After all, pleasure is really in work. And there is nothing sweeter than the fruit of my own works ... No, I’ll take care of labor, I will settle in the village, and I will be taken honestly, so as to have a good effect on others. Well, really, as if I'm already completely worthless? I have the ability to farm; I have the qualities of frugality, and flipper, and prudence, even constancy. One has only to decide, I feel that there is. Now I only truly and clearly feel that there is some duty that a person needs to be fulfilled on earth, without looking up from the place and corner on which he is decided.

And the hardworking life, remote from the noise of cities and those seduces that he invented from idleness, having forgotten labor, a person, began to draw so much in front of him that he had almost forgotten all the troubles of his position and, perhaps, was ready to resign the provision for this Heavy <lesson>, if only they release it and give it off at least part. But ... The one -wound door of his unclean closet dissolved, the bureaucratic person came in - the Samosvists, the Epicurean, the dashing, an excellent comrade, the purge and a blowing beast, as the comrades themselves expressed about him. In wartime, this man would have done miracles: to send him somewhere to get through the impenetrable, dangerous places, to steal a gun in front of the nose at the enemy himself-this is his case. But for the lack of a military field, on which, perhaps, he was an honest person, he was dirty and shit. Incomprehensible business! He was good with his comrades, did not sell anyone and, giving his word, kept; But he considered the highest over to himself the authorities with a kind of enemy battery through which it was necessary to break through, using every weak place, breaks or missing ...

- We know everything about your position, everything heard! He said when he saw that the door was shut tight behind him. - Nothing, nothing! Do not rob: everything will be corrected. Everything will work for you and - your servants! Thirty thousand for all - and nothing more.

- Like? - cried out Chichikov. - And I will be completely justified?

- Around! You will also receive rewards for losses.

- And for work? ..

- Thirty thousand. There is already all together-both ours, and the Governor-General, and the secretary.

“But let me, how can I?” My all things ... box ... all this is now sealed, under supervision ...

- In an hour, get everything. Hand, or what?

Chichikov gave his hand. His heart was beating, and he did not trust that it was possible ...

- For now, goodbye! I instructed you <say> our common friend, that the main thing is peace and presence.

“Um! - thought Chichikov, - I understand: a legal adviser! "

Samosvists disappeared. Chichikov, remaining, still did not trust the words how the hour did not go after this conversation, how the box was brought: papers, money - and everything is in the best order. Samosvists appeared as the manager: he chose the sent sentences for looking carelessly, ordered to put extra soldiers to intensify the supervision, took not only the box, but took even all the papers that could compromise Chichikov; He tied all this together, sealed it and ordered the soldier himself to immediately attribute to Chichikov himself, in the form of the necessary night and sleeping things, so Chichikov, along with papers, received even all the warm ones that needed to cover his mortal body. This soon delivery pleased him incredibly. He had a strong hope, and some bait had already begun to dream again: in the evening the theater, dance, behind which he dragged. The village and silence became paler, the city and noise - again brighter, clearer ... Oh, life!

Meanwhile, the work of the unlimited in the courts and wards began. The feathers of the scribes worked, and, smelling of tobacco, the casus heads worked, admiring the hooking line like artists. The legal adviser, like a hidden magician, invisibly tossed the whole mechanism; He entangled everyone decisively before anyone managed to look around. The confusion has increased. Samosvists surpassed himself with courage and insolence unheard of. Upon learning where the captured woman was punished, he appeared directly and entered such a well done and the boss that the sentry made him honor and stretched out into the string.

- How long have you been standing here?

- In the morning, your nobleness!

- For a long time before the shift?

- Three hours, your nobleness!

- I will need you. I will tell the officer that you will bring you another.

- Listen, your nobleness!

And, having left home, not a minute for a minute, so as not to knead anyone and all the ends into the water, he himself dressed up the gendarme, ended up in the mustache and bacenbards - he would not have recognized the devil himself. He appeared in the house where Chichikov was, and, grabbing the first woman, what he came across, handed her to two officials, the docks, too, and he directly appeared, in the mustache and with a gun, as it should, to the sentries:

- Go, I sent me the commander to survive, it has a shift. - He exchanged with the sentry and became with a gun.

Only that was and needed. At this time, the former woman turned out to be another, who knew nothing and did not understand anything. The kuda was hidden so that they did not find out where she went. At a time when the Samosvists worked in the person of a warrior, the legal adviser produced miracles in the civilian field: he let the governor know to the governor that the prosecutor was writing a denunciation for him; The gendarme official let him know, <u that> a secretly living official writes denunciations for him; The secretly living official assured that there was another secret official who reports to him - and brought everyone to the situation that they had to turn to him for advice. Such a stupid occurred: the denunciation sat on the denunciation, and there were such deeds that the sun did not see, and even those that were not there. Everything went to work and in the matter: who is an illegitimate son, and what kind and title who has a mistress, and whose wife is dragging behind. Scandals, temptations, and everything was so confused and woven along with Chichikov’s story, with dead souls, which in no way could not understand, which of these matters was the most important nonsense: both seemed equal dignity. When the Paper General Governor finally began to arrive, the poor prince could not understand anything. A very smart and quick official who was instructed to make an extract almost lost his mind: it was impossible to catch the thread of business in any way. The prince was at that time preoccupied with many other things, one another unpleasant. In one part of the province was hunger. Officials sent to give out bread somehow did not dispose of as follows. The schismatics stirred in another part of the province. Someone missed between them that the Antichrist was born, who does not give rest to the dead, buying up some dead souls. They repented and sinned and, under the guise of catching the Antichrist, chopped off the Neanthritists. In another place, the men rebelled against the landowners and captain-enforcement officers. Some tramps missed rumors between them that there was such a time that the men should be <be> the landowners and dress up in tailcoats, and the landowners will look into the Armenians and there will be men-and a whole volost, not the case that the landowners will come out then then And the captain-enforcement officers refused to pay all. It was necessary to resort to violent measures. The poor prince was in the most upset state of mind. At this time, they reported to him that the farmer had come.

“Let him enter,” said the prince.

The old man ascended ...

- Here you have Chichikov! You stood for him and defended him. Now he was caught in a case that the last thief will not be decided on.

- Let me report to you, your excellency, that I do not really understand this business.

- The forge of the will, and what else! .. Public punishment with lashes for a sort of business!

- Your Excellency, I will not say to defend Chichikov. But this is not proven: the investigation has not yet been done.

- Evidence: a woman who was dressed up in a deceased, captured. I want to ask her on purpose with you. - The prince called and ordered that woman to call.

Murazov fell silent.

- A dishonest business! And, to shame, the first officials of the city, the governor himself, were imposed. He should not be where thieves and loafers! - said the prince with the heat.

- After all, the governor is the heir; He has the right to claim; And that others clung from all sides is, sir, your excellency, human business. The rich died, the orders of the smart and fair did not make; The hunters flew from all sides - human business ...

“But why abominations are to do? .. Scrapers!” - said the prince with a feeling of indignation. - I don’t have a good official good: everything is bastards!

- Your Excellency! But which of us, as it should, is good? All officials of our city are people, have dignity and many who know very well in business, and all is close to sin.

- Listen, Afanasy Vasilievich, tell me, I know you alone for an honest person, what kind of passion to protect all kinds of bastards?

“Your Excellency,” said Murazov, “whoever is the person whom you call a bastard, but he is a person.” How not to protect a person when you know what he does half of evil from rudeness and ignorance? After all, we are doing injustice at every step and every minute we are the reason for the misfortune of the other, even not with a bad intention. After all, your Excellency also made great injustice.

- How! - exclaimed in amazement the prince, completely struck by such an unexpected turnover of speech.

Murazov stopped, paused, as if thinking something, and finally said:

- Yes, at least in the case of Derpennikov. [106]

- Afanasy Vasilievich! The crime is against indigenous state laws equal to treason!

- I do not justify him. But is it true that if the young man, who, by his inexperience, was seduced and drunk by others, to condemn as one who was one of the instigators? After all, the fate befell the smooth and Derpennikov, and some Vorono-Dryannaya; But their crime is not equal.

“For God's sake ...” said the prince with a noticeable excitement, “do you know anything about this?” Tell. It was I who recently sent directly to St. Petersburg to mitigate his fate.

-No, your excellency, I'm not about that I say that I know something that you do not know. Although, for sure, there is one such circumstance that would serve in his favor, but he himself will not agree, because <that> another would suffer another. And I think only that you did not deign to hurry then. Sorry, your excellency, I judge by my weak mind. You ordered me to speak frankly several times. I have, when I was still a boss, there were a lot of all kinds of workers, and bad and good ... It should also be taken into account and the previous life of a person, because if you do not consider everything coldly, but you will shout the first time, you only intimidate You won’t achieve him, and you will not achieve the recognition of the present: but as you ask him with the participation, as a brother’s brother, he will express everything himself and does not even ask for softening, and there are no fiercely against anyone, because he clearly sees that I do not punish him, but law.

The prince thought. At this time, a young official entered and respectfully stopped with a portfolio. Care, labor expressed on his young and still fresh face. It was evident that it was not without reason that he served in special guarantees. This was one of the few who was engaged in the paperwork Con Amore. Without burning a bitterness, nor the desire of profit, nor imitating others, he was engaged only because he was convinced that he needed to be here, and not in another place, that his life was given to him. To monitor, to disassemble in parts and, having caught all the threads of the confusing business, clarify him - this was his business. And the works, and efforts, and sleepless nights were rewarded abundantly if the matter finally began to explain before him, the innermost reasons to be discouraged, and he felt that he could convey him everything in a few words, clearly and clearly, so that everyone would be obvious and understandable. We can say that the student was not so much happy when some kind of difficult phrase was revealed before him and the real meaning of the thought of the great writer is discovered, as he was happy when the confusing business was unraveling before him. But ... [107]

[108] - ... bread in places where hunger; I know this part better officials: I will consider it personally that who needs it. Yes, if you allow, your excellency, I will talk with schismatics. They, with our brother, with a simple person, willing more willingly. So, God the news, perhaps, will help to settle peacefully with them. And I won’t take money from you, because, by golly, I’m ashamed to think about my profit at such a time when they die from hunger. I have ready -made bread in stock; I have now sent to Siberia, and they will be lifted to the future summer again.

- You can only reward one God for such a service, Afanasy Vasilievich. And I will not say a single word to you, because, you yourself can feel - every word here is powerless. But let me say one thing about that request. Say for yourself: do I have the right to leave this business unattended and is it fair, whether it will be honest from my part to forgive the bastards.

-Your Excellency, by golly, this one cannot be called, especially since there are many very worthy of them. The positions of a person are difficult, your excellency is very, very difficult. It happens that it seems that a person is to blame: and how you enter - even not him.

“But what will they say if I leave?” After all, there are from them, which after that will even more raise their nose and will even say that they scared. They will not be the first to respect ...

- Your Excellency, let me give you your opinion: gather them all, let them know that you know everything, and present them with your own position in exactly the same way as you deigned it now before me, and ask them for advice: What <would everyone do in your position?

- Yes, do you think the noble movements will be available to them than to beam and cash in? Believe me, they will laugh at me.

“I don't think, sir, your excellency.” The [109] person, even the one who is worse than others, is still fair. Is there any liquid, not Russian? No, your excellency, you have nothing to hide. Tell me as accurately as you deigned before I>. After all, they reproach you as a person’s ambitious, proud, who does not want to hear anything, is confident in himself - so let them see everything as it is. What do you need? After all, your business is right. Tell them as if you were not before them, but before God yourself brought your confession.

“Afanasy Vasilievich,” the prince said in thought, “I will think about it, and as long as I thank you for the advice.”

- And Chichikov, your excellency, order to let go.

- Tell this Chichikov to get out of here as soon as possible, and the further, the better. I would never forgive him.

Murazov bowed and directly from the prince went to Chichikov. He found Chichikov already in the spirit, which was very focused by a rather decent dinner, which was brought to him in earthenware vessels from some very decent cuisine. According to the first phrases of the conversation, the old man immediately noticed that Chichikov had already managed to talk with any of the officials-Kazusniks. He even realized that the invisible participation of a legal adviser intervened here.

“Listen, sir, Pavel Ivanovich,” he said, “I brought you freedom on such a condition that you are not in the city now.” Collect all your belongings - and with God, without delaying for a minute, because the matter is even worse. I know, sir, one person sets you up here; So I declare you a secret that such a thing is still opening, that no forces will save this. He, of course, is glad to drown others in order to be boring, but it's about cutting. I left you in a good location - the best than which now. I advise you, sir not jokingly. She- <her> is not a matter of this property, because of which people argue and cut each other, just how can I have improvement in the local life, without thinking about another life. Believe me, Pavel Ivanovich, that for the time being, we rose all that because of which they bite and eat each other on the ground, will not think about the improvement of mental property, improvement and earthly property will not be established. The times of hunger and poverty will come, both in all people and separately in every ... this is clear. Whatever you say, because the body depends on the heart. How to want to <go> as it should. Think not about dead souls, but <about> your living soul, and with God on another road! I'm leaving tomorrow. Hurry up! It will not be the trouble without me.

Having said this, the old man came out. Chichikov thought. The meaning of life again seemed important. “Murazov is right,” he said, “it's time for another road!” Having said this, he left prison. The sentry dragged the box behind him, the other was a suitcase of linen. Selifan and Parsley were delighted, as God knows what, the liberty of the master.

“Well, amiable,” said Chichikov, turning <to them> graciously, “you need to get along and go.”

“Swat, Pavel Ivanovich,” said Selifan. - The road must have been established: the snow fell enough. It's time, right, get out of the city. He was tired so that he would not want to look at him.

“Go to the carriage to put the stroller on the lips,” said Chichikov, and he went to the city himself, but he didn’t want to go to give farewell visits. After all this event, it was also embarrassed, especially since there were many of the most unfavorable stories about it. He avoided any meetings and slowly went to the merchant from whom he bought a cloth of the Navarinsky flame with smoke, took four arshins on the tailcoat and pants and went to the same tailor. For a double <price>, the master decided to strengthen zeal and planted a tailor to work all night by candles - with needles, ironing and teeth, and the tailcoat was ready the next day, although a little late. The horses were all harnessed. Chichikov, however, tried the tailcoat. He was good, exactly like the same. But alas! He noticed that something smooth in his head was already white, and smashed sadly: “And why was it to indulge in so much crushing? But the hair should not be even more so. ” Having paid with the tailor, he finally left the city in some strange situation. It was not the former Chichikov. It was some kind of ruin of the former Chichikov. It was possible to compare his inner state of the soul with a disassembled building, which is dismantled in order to build a new one from it; And the new one has not yet begun, because the determined plan did not come from the architect and the employees remained in bewilderment. An hour earlier, the old man Murazov went, in the molested whale, along with Potapych, and an hour after Chichikov left, the order was that the prince, on the occasion of leaving for St. Petersburg, wants to see all officials to one.

In the large hall of the Governor's General General, the whole bureau of the city gathered, from the governor to the titular adviser: the rulers of the office and affairs, advisers, assessors, acids, Krasnonosov, dump trucks, who did not take, who took the soul, who were shrugging and not crouched at all,-not at all,- Everything expected with some not quite calm expectation of the general output. The prince came out neither gloomy nor clear: his gaze was firm, just like a step ... The whole official meeting bowed, many in the belt. By answering a slight bow, the prince began:

- Leaving in St. Petersburg, I felt decent to see you all and even explain the reason to you partly. We have a very seductive case. I believe that many of the upcoming know what business I am talking about. This case led after itself the discovery of other, no less dishonest affairs, in which even finally such people were involved, which I readly revered honestly. I even know the innermost goal to confuse everything in this way so that the complete impossibility of solving a formal order is. I even know, and who is the main spring and whose innermost ..., [110] Although he very skillfully hid his participation. But the fact is that I intend to monitor this not by the formal one by the papers, but by the military quick court, as in the military “time>, and I hope that the sovereign will give me this right when I state the whole thing. In this case, when there is no way to make a civilian way when cabinets with “papers” are burning and, finally, the excess of false extraneous testimonies and with false denunciations try to darken already a rather dark case - I believe the military court and want to know the opinion yours.

The prince stopped, as <would> waiting for an answer. Everything stood, pulling his eyes into the ground. Many were pale.

- I also know one more thing, although he produced it in complete confidence that it cannot be known to anyone. Its production will not go on papers, because I will already be the plaintiff and petition and will present obvious evidence.

Someone shuddered among the official meeting; Some of the fearful were also embarrassed.

- By itself, that the main instigators should follow the deprivation of ranks and property, otherwise - detachment from places. It goes without saying that among them many innocent will suffer. What to do? The matter is too dishonorable and yells about justice. Although I know that this will not even be in the lesson for others, because others will appear in the highs, and those who were honestly honest will become dishonest, and those that will be awarded the power of attorney, will deceive and sell, despite everything, - despite everything This, I have to do cruelly, because it yells justice. I know that they will accuse me of severe cruelty, but I know that they will still be ... [111] I will blame me the same ... I have to turn into only one insensitive instrument of justice, the ax that should fall on my head.

The shudder involuntarily ran through all faces.

The prince was calm. Neither anger nor the indignation of the soul expressed his face.

- Now the one in whom in the hands of the fate of many and whom no requests were able to implore, the same one is now rushing to your feet, you are asking you all. Everything will be forgotten, applied, forgiven; I will sing for everyone myself if you fulfill my request. Here is my request. I know that no means, no punishments can be eradicated by any means, no fears, and she was too deeply rooted. The dishonest thing to take bribes became necessity and need even for people who are not born to be dishonest. I know that it is almost impossible for many to go against universal teets against. But now I owe, as in a decisive and sacred minute, when I have to save my fatherland, when every citizen carries everything and sacrifices everything, I have to make a cry, even to those who still have a Russian heart in my chest and it is clear any word "nobility". What to say about who is more to blame for! I may be most to blame; I may have accepted you too severely at the beginning; Perhaps, excessively suspicion, I pushed out of you those who sincerely wanted to be useful to me, although I, for my part, could also make a reproach. If they really loved the justice and good of their land, they should not be offended by the arrogance of my appeal, they should suppress their own ambition and sacrifice their personality. It cannot be that I do not notice their dedication and high love for good and would not finally accept useful and smart advice from them. Still, as soon as the subordinate should be applied to the authority of the boss than the boss to the disposition of the subordinate. This is more legitimate, at least, and easier, because the subordinates have one boss, and the boss has hundreds of subordinates. But now let's leave to the side, who is more to blame. The fact is that it came to save our land; that our earth is already dying not from the invasion of twenty foreign languages, but from ourselves; That already, past the legal governance, another rule has formed, much strongest of all legal. Their conditions have been established; Everything is estimated, and prices are even given universal fame. And no ruler, even if he was wiser than all lawmakers and rulers, could not correct evil, like <NI> limit him in the actions of bad officials with a refinery in the overseers of other officials. Everything will be unsuccessfully, until everyone felt from us that he, just as in the era of uprising, the people were armed against <enemies>, he should rebel against untruth. As a Russian, as a linked relationship associated with you, one and the same blood, I now turn <k> to you. I turn to those of you who have any understanding about what the nobility of thoughts is. I invite you to recall the duty that a person has to be in every place. I invite you to consider my duty and the obligation of my earthly position closer, because it is already dark to us all, and we barely ... [112]
