# LiteraryMachineTranslation

1. Translations + translators data
2. Word alignment
3. Machine + human translation evaluation
4. Par3

## TODO
What we want: see how bleu/bleurt “correlate” with alignment
Hypothesis - higher aer between ref translations -> better translation, low aer -> has been some issue
AER
APT-eval -> word alignment method for assessing translation quality of idioms
LiTER - is for evaluating translation quality of idioms -> for this we need to already have examples of idioms
Double task: finding idioms/non-compositional language automatically + evaluating idioms?

- Larger paragraphs
- Get text format of Russian book ( with lots of idioms)
- Russian idiom list
